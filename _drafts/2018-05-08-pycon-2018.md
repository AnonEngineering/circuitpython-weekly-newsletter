![PyCon 2018 Gemma M0]({{ "/assets/PyConGEMMA.jpg" | absolute_url }}){:width="550px"}

This week is [PyCon US 2018](https://us.pycon.org/2018/) in Cleveland starting tomorrow May 9th! It is the largest annual gathering for the community using and developing the open-source Python programming language. It is produced and underwritten by the [Python Software Foundation](https://www.python.org/psf-landing/), the 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization dedicated to advancing and promoting Python. Through PyCon, the PSF advances its mission of growing the international community of Python programmers. Adafruit is a sponsor, we'll see you in the goodie bag :)

Scott ([@tannewt](https://github.com/tannewt/)), Dan ([dhalbert](https://github.com/dhalbert/)) and Kattni ([@kattni](https://github.com/kattni/)) will be there starting Thursday. We'll have at least one Open Space during the talks, [an AdaBox 006](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3697) at the [PyLadies Auction](https://us.pycon.org/2018/events/auction/) and a single sprint day to work on 3.0.0. Please catch us [on Discord](https:/adafru.it/discord) before and during PyCon for the latest meet up times.
