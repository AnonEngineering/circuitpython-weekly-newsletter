## 10 Years of Programming Language Evolution, Python #1 spot

[![10 Years of Programming Language Evolution](../assets/10082019/10819python.jpg)](https://www.eetimes.com/document.asp?doc_id=1335168#)

[A bit of repost](https://www.eetimes.com/document.asp?doc_id=1335168#), but now with some more info and some Python on hardware...

>_"IEEE Spectrum released its annual ranking of program languages last month and many were surprised to see Python maintained its top spot. Python, a script-based language, has held the top spot in IEEE Spectrum’s ranking since 2017. That’s not the surprise. IEEE scores the languages using a weighted scale. Last year, Python had a score of 100, while C++ scored 99.7, Java scored 97.5, and C scored 96.7. This year, however, the landscape of languages changed. Python maintained its top spot with a score of 100, but Java came in second with a score of 96.3 — quite a fall. C came in third with 94.4, C++ slid all the way into fourth place with a score of 87.5, and statistical programming language R took the fifth spot with a score of 81.5. Spots 6-10 were taken by JavaScript, C#, MATLAB, Swift, and Google’s Go, in that order.... Python, Java, JavaScript, and C are versatile languages that keep them widely used. Speaking specifically to Python, there are many specialized libraries that support machine learning, deep learning (Theano), AI, and maker libraries for microcontrollers and tiny computers like Adafruit..."_
