PYBD boards, BLE and littlefs, dynamic native modules, samd, powerpc and more, nice update! - [GitHub](https://github.com/micropython/micropython/releases/tag/v1.12).

## 94 boards on Circuitpython.org !

[![94](../assets/12242019/12241994boards.gif)](https://circuitpython.org/downloads)

There are over 94+ boards on circuitpython.org. Less than half of the boards are from Adafruit, there are 40 Adafruit-made boards and 54+ from everyone else! This means there an entire ecosystem of boards out there from makers and companies around the world, all that run the open-source CircuitPython! - [circuitpython.org/downloads](https://circuitpython.org/downloads). 100 boards here we come!

[![Preview](../assets/12242019/122419preview.png)](https://circuitpython.org/)

Speaking of [circuitpython.org](https://circuitpython.org), we'll have an update to the pages soon, this is super-seckret preview!

## CircuitPython 4.1.2 released!

[![CP 412](../assets/12242019/1224194319-05.jpg)](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/releases/tag/4.1.2)

4.1.2 is a minor stable release. Most notably, it updates the adafruit_circuitplayground frozen library for Circuit Playground Express. It shouldn’t break any code compatible with previous 4.x releases. If you don’t have a Circuit Playground Express or a PyRuler, or a board with frozen libraries, there is no strong reason to update to 4.1.2 - [GitHub](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/releases/tag/4.1.2).

## CircuitPython 5.0.0 Beta 2 related

[![CP beta 2](../assets/12242019/)](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/releases)

This is release 5.0.0 beta.2. It improves our internal filesystem definitions and may overwrite your existing files so make sure to back them up before updating! Beta releases are largely feature-complete, but are meant for testing. Use the latest stable 4.x release when first starting with CircuitPython - [GitHub](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/releases).

## Updated Guides - Now With More Python!

**You can use CircuitPython libraries on Raspberry Pi!** We're updating all of our CircuitPython guides to show how to wire up sensors to your Raspberry Pi, and load the necessary CircuitPython libraries to get going using them with Python. We'll be including the updates here so you can easily keep track of which sensors are ready to go. Check it out!

Keep checking back for more updated guides!

## CircuitPython Libraries!

[![CircuitPython Libraries](../assets/12242019/122419blinka.png)](https://circuitpython.org/libraries)

CircuitPython support for hardware continues to grow. We are adding support for new sensors and breakouts all the time, as well as improving on the drivers we already have. As we add more libraries and update current ones, you can keep up with all the changes right here!

For the latest drivers, download the [Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries).

If you'd like to contribute, CircuitPython libraries are a great place to start. Have an idea for a new driver? File an issue on [CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues)! Interested in helping with current libraries? Check out the [CircuitPython.org Contributing page](https://circuitpython.org/contributing). We've included open pull requests and issues from the libraries, and details about repo-level issues that need to be addressed. We have a guide on [contributing to CircuitPython with Git and Github](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github) if you need help getting started. You can also find us in the #circuitpython channel on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord). Feel free to contact Kattni (@kattni) with any questions.

You can check out this [list of all the CircuitPython libraries and drivers available](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/blob/master/circuitpython_library_list.md).

Codecademy, an online interactive learning platform used by more than 45 million people, has teamed up with the leading manufacturer in STEAM electronics, Adafruit Industries, to create a coding course, "Learn Hardware Programming with CircuitPython". The course is now available in the [Codecademy catalog](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-circuitpython?utm_source=adafruit&utm_medium=partners&utm_campaign=circuitplayground&utm_content=pythononhardwarenewsletter).

Python is a highly versatile, easy to learn programming language that a wide range of people, from visual effects artists in Hollywood to mission control at NASA, use to quickly solve problems. But you don’t need to be a rocket scientist to accomplish amazing things with it. This new course introduces programmers to Python by way of a microcontroller — CircuitPython — which is a Python-based programming language optimized for use on hardware.

CircuitPython’s hardware-ready design makes it easier than ever to program a variety of single-board computers, and this course gets you from no experience to working prototype faster than ever before. Codecademy’s interactive learning environment, combined with Adafruit's highly rated Circuit Playground Express, present aspiring hardware hackers with a never-before-seen opportunity to learn hardware programming seamlessly online.

Whether for those who are new to programming, or for those who want to expand their skill set to include physical computing, this course will have students getting familiar with Python and creating incredible projects along the way. By the end, students will have built their own bike lights, drum machine, and even a moisture detector that can tell when it's time to water a plant.
