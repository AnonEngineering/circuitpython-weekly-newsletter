The Metro M4 Express running CircuitPython was the hot product launch two weeks ago. While the hardware itself is in Beta, CircuitPython is still in Alpha. Last week, we released CircuitPython 3.0.0 Alpha 6. It gets closer to Beta by reintroducing the `nvm` module and audio output support (including I2S). It also introduces real-time clock support and USB HID gamepad support! Please update and let us know how it works for you on [Discord](https://adafru.it/discord)!

## Metro M4 Express Bootloader Fix!

If you managed to order a Metro M4 Express BETA from the very first batch, then please update your bootloader based on [these instructions](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-metro-m4-express-featuring-atsamd51/beta-notes). Without this, there is a risk the bootloader can be corrupted and make it impossible to load new code without a JLink! Subsequent batches won't have this issue.
