## CircuitPython 4.0.0 beta 6

[![CircuitPython 4.0.0 beta 6]({{ "/assets/4219beta6.jpg" | absolute_url }}){:width="550px"}](https://blog.adafruit.com/2019/03/29/circuitpython-4-0-0-beta-6-released/)

We are nearing the end of the betas of 4.0.0, and hope to be issuing a release candidate soon. There are still [a few issues to fix before stable](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%224.0.0+-+Bluetooth%22). We think the API's are now stable. Please use the latest 3.x stable release [(available from the new website!)](https://circuitpython.org/downloads) when first starting with CircuitPython. It is stable.

When you find a bug please [check the current known issues](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues) and [file an issue](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues/new) if something isn't already known - [Adafruit](https://blog.adafruit.com/2019/03/29/circuitpython-4-0-0-beta-6-released/).

## Python and the Internet of Things Hack Chat

[![Hack Chat]({{ "/assets/4219hackchat01.jpg" | absolute_url }}){:width="550px"}](https://hackaday.io/event/164062-python-and-the-internet-of-things-hack-chat)

[Python and the Internet of Things Hack Chat @ Hackaday.io](https://hackaday.io/event/164062-python-and-the-internet-of-things-hack-chat). The power of Python on microcontrollers - Wednesday, April 3, 2019 12:00pm PDT / 3pm EDT a Hack Chat at hackaday.io! The CircuitPython team from Adafruit ([Dan Halbert](https://hackaday.io/dhalbert), [Kattni Rembor](https://hackaday.io/hacker/277997-kattni), [Scott Shawcroft](https://hackaday.io/tannewt), [Limor "Ladyada" Fried](https://hackaday.io/ladyada), and [Phillip Torrone](https://hackaday.io/pt)) will be hosting the Hack Chat on Wednesday, April 3, 2019 at noon PDT / 3pm EDT. Time zones got you down? [Here's a handy time converter](https://www.timeanddate.com/countdown/generic?iso=20190403T12&p0=137&font=cursive)! Opinions differ about what the most-used programming language in right now is, but it's hard to deny both the popularity and versatility of Python. In the nearly 30 years since it was invented it has grown from niche language to full-blown development environment that seems to be everywhere these days. That includes our beloved microcontrollers now with [CircuitPython](https://learn.adafruit.com/welcome-to-circuitpython), greatly lowering the bar for entry-level hackers and simplifying and speeding development for old hands and providing a path to a Python-powered Internet of Things. The CircuitPython team from Adafruit Industries will drop by the Hack Chat to answer all your questions about Python and the IoT. Join us as we discuss:

*   How CircuitPython came to be;
*   The range of IoT products that support Python;
*   Getting started with Python on IoT devices; and
*   What's on the horizon for a Python-powered IoT?

## Let's Talk About the MSGEQ7: Porting Arduino Code to CircuitPython

[![MSGEQ7]({{ "/assets/4219blitz.jpg" | absolute_url }}){:width="550px"}](https://youtu.be/LapPe2nKFLk)

Blitz City DIY has a great video on proting Arduino code to CircuitPython. Liz starts out with some projects based around the MSGEQ7 IC. First up, Liz ported the initial Arduino example code to CircuitPython and I also talks about the love for the MSGEQ7 chip - [YouTube](https://youtu.be/LapPe2nKFLk) & [code on GitHub](https://github.com/BlitzCityDIY/MSGEQ7_experiments/blob/master/3-17-19_msgeq7_test.py).

## REVIEW - Jetson Nano: Is it AI for the masses?

[![Jetson Nano BLINKA]({{ "/assets/4219jetson.jpg" | absolute_url }}){:width="550px"}](https://www.androidauthority.com/jetson-nano-review-969318/)

[androidauthority.com](https://www.androidauthority.com/jetson-nano-review-969318/) has a review of the new Jetson Nano with great overview to check out if you're thinking of trying out Nvidia’s latest machine learning development platform. For hardware support, BLINKA is there too:

>_"One of the key features of the Raspberry Pi is its set of General Purpose Input and Output (GPIO) pins. They allow you to connect the Pi to external hardware like LEDs, sensors, motors, displays, and more. The Jetson Nano also has a set of GPIO pins and the good news is that they are Raspberry Pi compatible. Initial support is limited to the Adafruit Blinka library and to userland control of the pins. However, all of the plumbing is there to allow broad support for many of the Raspberry Pi HATs available."_

## uChip - CircuitPython powered Kickstarter

[![uChip]({{ "/assets/4219uchip01.jpg" | absolute_url }}){:width="550px"}](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1186620431/uchip-arduino-zero-compatible-in-a-narrow-dip-16-p)

[![uChip]({{ "/assets/4219uchip03.jpg" | absolute_url }}){:width="550px"}](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1186620431/uchip-arduino-zero-compatible-in-a-narrow-dip-16-p)

[uChip: Arduino Zero compatible in a narrow DIP-16 package! by Itaca Innovation — Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1186620431/uchip-arduino-zero-compatible-in-a-narrow-dip-16-p). A very small narrow-DIP-sized, Arduino Zero compatible USB dev board (OTG enabled), with integrated buck and boost power supplies.

We worked with the team and there is CircuitPython support (thanks for the pull request!) and it’s [available to view on circuitpython.org](https://circuitpython.org/board/uchip/)! The usual disclaimer applies, it’s a Kickstarter, so anything could happen (or not!), that said – it’s open-source hardware and the team has actual hardware already, so if they hit the funding goal, seems likely it ship. If you have a Kickstarter with actual hardware and you have CircuitPython running on it (or want to, let us know – we can help!).

Big news! Digi-Key and Adafruit have teamed up for PyCon 2019 so every attendee (about 4,000!) will receive a [SPECIAL EDITION Circuit Playground Express](https://youtu.be/ZMx6qB-7z9U), running … CircuitPython.

This effort is to get Python on hardware to the most folks out there, at the events that bring people together.

This is just one of many efforts we’re teaming up with Digi-Key to continue to fuel all the developers from beginners to pro, using Python on microcontrollers.

What else is happening? The CircuitPython team will be running several Open Spaces sessions (as they did last year), showing how to use CircuitPython on the Digi-Key / Adafruit PyCon special edition Circuit Playground Express. We’ll have extra addons to play with also: potentiometers, NeoPixel strips, and servos. The team will be running a CircuitPython Sprint for several days to work on CircuitPython libraries and CircuitPython core code. BYOMUSB “Bring your own Micro USB” cables, we’ll have some to borrow during the sprints/sessions, as well as some USB C adapters, good idea to bring one too!

The PyCon 2019 conference, which will take place in Cleveland, is the largest annual gathering for the community using and developing the open-source Python programming language. It is produced and underwritten by the Python Software Foundation, the 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization dedicated to advancing and promoting Python. Through PyCon, the PSF advances its mission of growing the international community of Python programmers.

We will have a lot more updates, stay tuned to the [Adafruit blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/category/circuitpython/), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/adafruit), [Discord](http://adafru.it/discord), and more!

Downloads are now available from [circuitpython.org](https://circuitpython.org)! This site makes it much easier to select the correct file and language for your board. The downloads page is [here](https://circuitpython.org/downloads). We could use some help with filling in the text for the various boards.

## Call for help – CircuitPython messaging to other languages!

[![Hello world]({{ "/assets/4219hello.jpg" | absolute_url }}){:width="550px"}](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues/1098)

We [posted on the Adafruit blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2018/08/15/help-bring-circuitpython-messaging-to-other-languages-circuitpython/) about bringing CircuitPython messaging to other languages, one of the exciting features of CircuitPython 4.x is translated control and error messages. Native language messages will help non-native English speakers understand what is happening in CircuitPython even though the Python keywords and APIs will still be in English. If you would like to help, [please post](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues/1098) to the main issue on GitHub and join us on [Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

We made this graphic with translated text, we could use your help with that to make sure we got the text right, please check out the text in the image – if there is anything we did not get correct, please let us know. Dan sent me this [handy site too](http://helloworldcollection.de/#Human).
