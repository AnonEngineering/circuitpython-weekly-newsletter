## A speedier CircuitPython gets 10 out of 10 in the latest issue of HackSpace Magazine

[![SpeedyPython](../assets/07232019/72319speed01.jpg)](https://blog.adafruit.com/2019/07/19/a-speedier-circuitpython-gets-10-out-of-10-in-the-latest-issue-of-hackspace-magazine-hackspacemag-circuitpython-adafruit/)

A speedier CircuitPython gets **10 out of 10** in the latest issue of [HackSpace Magazine](http://hsmag.cc/CuWiCK), [page 128 in the PDF](https://magazines-static.raspberrypi.org/issues/full_pdfs/000/000/091/original/HackSpaceMagazine21.pdf), [online](https://hackspace.raspberrypi.org/features/circuitpython-4-1-0-review), via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/HackSpaceMag/status/1152230012927561729) –

>_"The big feature of the free software, CircuitPython 4.1. is the speed. You can see the box below for more information on the benchmarks we ran but, in short, the new version is quite a bit quicker. Basic operations, such as floating point and integer arithmetic, were about twice as fast, and it was particularly interesting to see that this performance improvement filtered all the way through to the devices controlled by the board. We were able to flash NeoPixels at twice the rate using this firmware – we’re particularly pleased to see this, as we’ve run into performance issues running NeoPixel matrixes with CircuitPython in the past. There are also big performance gains when controlling screens. While the software has been moving along, so too has hardware support, and there’s now a greater range of supported hardware than ever before. At the time of writing, there were 62 separate devices on the circuitpython.org downloads page, so there’s a great selection to choose from, if you want to get developing with this language."_

[![SpeedyPython](../assets/07232019/72319speed02.jpg)](https://blog.adafruit.com/2019/07/19/a-speedier-circuitpython-gets-10-out-of-10-in-the-latest-issue-of-hackspace-magazine-hackspacemag-circuitpython-adafruit/)

We are 100% focused on ease of use, being able to do more in minutes. CircuitPython is a programming language designed to simplify experimenting and learning to code on low-cost microcontroller boards. It makes getting started easier than ever with no upfront desktop downloads needed. Once you get your board set up, open any text editor, and get started editing code. It's that simple. 

**Quick and Easy**

Create a file, edit your code, save the file, and it runs immediately. There is no compiling, no downloading and no uploading needed. 

**Beginner Friendly** 

CircuitPython is designed with education in mind. It's easy to start learning how to code and you get immediate feedback from the board. 

**Easy Code Updates**

Since your code lives on the disk drive, you can edit it whenever you like, you can also keep multiple files around for easy experimentation.

**Serial Console + REPL**

These allow for live feedback from your code and interactive programming.

**File Storage**

The internal storage for CircuitPython makes it great for data-logging, playing audio clips, and otherwise interacting with files. 

**Strong Hardware Support**

There are many libraries and drivers for sensors, breakout boards and other external components. 

However it's also nice that there are significant speed increases too :)

[295 - In the key of lime - Embedded.fm podcast](https://embedded.fm/episodes/295) -

>_"This week we talk about [CircuitPython](https://circuitpython.org/) ([@CircuitPython](https://twitter.com/CircuitPython)) with [@adafruit](https://twitter.com/adafruit)’s Kattni Rembor ([@kattni](https://twitter.com/kattni)) and Scott Shawcroft ([@tannewt](https://twitter.com/tannewt)). The suggested first board is [CircuitPlayground Express](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3333) with LEDs, sensors, and buttons. CircuitPython is also available for many other boards including the [BLE Feather](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4062) (NRF52832). For a basic introduction take a look at [What is CircuitPython](https://learn.adafruit.com/welcome-to-circuitpython/what-is-circuitpython) and [see some example scripts](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_CircuitPlayground). To dig a little deeper, check out the many resources in [Awesome CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/awesome-circuitpython/blob/master/README.md). The whole thing is open source so [you can see their code](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython). If you are thinking about contributing (or just want some fun chats), get in touch on the CircuitPython channel of the Adafruit Discord server: [adafru.it/discord](https://adafru.it/discord) Many of the language’s design choices favor ease-of-use over ready-for-production. Imagine teaching an intro to programming class without worrying what computers will be used or how to get compilers installed on everyone’s machines before time runs out."_

## Update! iOS 13 beta erases files off drive, resets iPad: FAT12 issue - FIXED, MAYBE!

[![iOS update](../assets/07232019/72319iosver.jpg)](https://blog.adafruit.com/2019/06/25/ios-13-beta-1-erases-files-off-drive-resets-ipad-fat12-issue-it-seems-apple/)

[![iOS update](../assets/07232019/72319codepy.jpg)](https://blog.adafruit.com/2019/06/25/ios-13-beta-1-erases-files-off-drive-resets-ipad-fat12-issue-it-seems-apple/)

Good news, maybe! It looks like the latest iOS 13 beta fixed the issue of all the files getting deleted when browsing to the file system on the USB drive. We do not know if editing and saving .py files works yet as there are no apps that aware of the external storage. From what we understand that is coming in September of this year. That being said, it's looking REALLY GOOD for opening, editing, and saving, CircuitPython on iOS devices!

Codecademy, an online interactive learning platform used by more than 45 million people, has teamed up with the leading manufacturer in STEAM electronics, Adafruit Industries, to create a coding course, "Learn Hardware Programming with CircuitPython". The course is now available in the [Codecademy catalog](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-circuitpython?utm_source=adafruit&utm_medium=partners&utm_campaign=circuitplayground&utm_content=pythononhardwarenewsletter).

Python is a highly versatile, easy to learn programming language that a wide range of people, from visual effects artists in Hollywood to mission control at NASA, use to quickly solve problems. But you don’t need to be a rocket scientist to accomplish amazing things with it. This new course introduces programmers to Python by way of a microcontroller — CircuitPython — which is a Python-based programming language optimized for use on hardware.

CircuitPython’s hardware-ready design makes it easier than ever to program a variety of single-board computers, and this course gets you from no experience to working prototype faster than ever before. Codecademy’s interactive learning environment, combined with Adafruit's highly rated Circuit Playground Express, present aspiring hardware hackers with a never-before-seen opportunity to learn hardware programming seamlessly online.

Whether for those who are new to programming, or for those who want to expand their skill set to include physical computing, this course will have students getting familiar with Python and creating incredible projects along the way. By the end, students will have built their own bike lights, drum machine, and even a moisture detector that can tell when it's time to water a plant.
