## CRICKITs of the week!

![MORE COWBELL]({{ "/assets/cowbell.jpg" | absolute_url }}){:width="550px"}

Don't fear the CRICKIT "more cowbell" robot. On start up, directs users that cowbell is very important, uses rotary knob to increase the frequency of striking the cowbell, the NeoPixels indicate green for good and red, more cowbell. A fun hack controls a fog machine, and the ending is as you may have guessed, still needs more cowbell - [video](https://youtu.be/sjisA9-YyrM) & [code](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Learning_System_Guides/blob/master/Crickits/dont_fear_the_crickit/code.py).

All our times have come
Here but now they're gone
Seasons don't fear the reaper
Nor do the wind, the sun or the rain, we can be like they are

![ROBOT ARM]({{ "/assets/robotarm.jpg" | absolute_url }}){:width="550px"}

Robot Arm CRICKIT. Testing a sample we were sent of a robot arm, not going to stock these arms, however, good experimenting - [code](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Learning_System_Guides/blob/master/Crickits/robot_arm/code.py) & [video](https://youtu.be/tVDJx2F_bMg).
