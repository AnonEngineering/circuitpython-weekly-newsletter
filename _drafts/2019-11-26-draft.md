## Python snakes its way to more newsstands

[![Python newsstand](../assets/11262019/11261901.jpg)](https://blog.adafruit.com/?s=%22we+are+what+we+celebrate%22&posts=ALL)

[![Python newsstand](../assets/11262019/11261902.jpg)](https://blog.adafruit.com/?s=%22we+are+what+we+celebrate%22&posts=ALL)

Magazine covers, even now, are still are one the places we as a society decide to celebrate specific people in some way. For business and tech publications, who, or what, we put on the cover and why says what’s important to us, what we’ve done, and where we are going.

For years we’ve done a feature here on Adafruit called “We are what we celebrate” which is a quick look at what is one the newsstands. Check out all the posts [“We are what we celebrate”](https://blog.adafruit.com/?s=%22we+are+what+we+celebrate%22&posts=ALL) on the Adafruit blog.

On a specific Python note, we're seeing more and more Python, and Python on hardware articles, books, and magazines - a welcome addition to newsstands.

[![CircuitPython and Bluetooth Low Energy by Ben Everard](../assets/11262019/112619page82-83.jpg)](https://hackspace.raspberrypi.org/issues/25)

What else? [CircuitPython and Bluetooth Low Energy](https://hackspace.raspberrypi.org/issues/25) by Ben Everard, Link your phone to your microcontroller to send data and commands –

>_"Bluetooth is in a bit of a funny position in the maker world. While theoretically it is really well placed to be a great addition to the maker toolkit, historically it’s not been widely utilised because it’s been hard to use. Part of the problem is the need to write two bits of software – one for the microcontroller, and one for whatever you’re sending data to it with, whether that’s a phone or computer. Where WiFi has enabled makers to do one side with a simple bit of HTML, Bluetooth has often needed a fully featured app. There’s also a bit of confusion about names – Bluetooth and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) are different things, yet are both often lumped under the moniker ‘Bluetooth’. We’ll be using BLE. Things are getting a little easier thanks to a really easy-to-use set of modules in CircuitPython and the Adafruit Bluefruit app."_

## News from around the web!

[![AD5245 Digital Potentiometer Breakout](../assets/11262019/112619AD5245.jpg)](https://hackaday.io/project/168605-ad5245-digital-potentiometer-breakout)

The AD5245 Digital Potentiometer breakout board is a simple implementation of the Analog Devices' I2C, 10K-ohm chip. The potentiometer sports 256 resistance steps and can work with a power source from 2.7v to 5.5v. The pins act similarly to a passive resistive potentiometer, but require that voltages placed on any of the three pins not exceed the power supply voltage or drop below ground potential. A CircuitPython library is included in the code folder of the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/CedarGroveStudios/AD5245_Digital_Pot).

Codecademy, an online interactive learning platform used by more than 45 million people, has teamed up with the leading manufacturer in STEAM electronics, Adafruit Industries, to create a coding course, "Learn Hardware Programming with CircuitPython". The course is now available in the [Codecademy catalog](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-circuitpython?utm_source=adafruit&utm_medium=partners&utm_campaign=circuitplayground&utm_content=pythononhardwarenewsletter).

Python is a highly versatile, easy to learn programming language that a wide range of people, from visual effects artists in Hollywood to mission control at NASA, use to quickly solve problems. But you don’t need to be a rocket scientist to accomplish amazing things with it. This new course introduces programmers to Python by way of a microcontroller — CircuitPython — which is a Python-based programming language optimized for use on hardware.

CircuitPython’s hardware-ready design makes it easier than ever to program a variety of single-board computers, and this course gets you from no experience to working prototype faster than ever before. Codecademy’s interactive learning environment, combined with Adafruit's highly rated Circuit Playground Express, present aspiring hardware hackers with a never-before-seen opportunity to learn hardware programming seamlessly online.

Whether for those who are new to programming, or for those who want to expand their skill set to include physical computing, this course will have students getting familiar with Python and creating incredible projects along the way. By the end, students will have built their own bike lights, drum machine, and even a moisture detector that can tell when it's time to water a plant.
