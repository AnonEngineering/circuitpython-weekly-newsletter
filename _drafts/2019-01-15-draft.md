## Python snakes its way on the SparkFun SAMD21 Mini

[![alt text]({{ "/assets/image_name" | absolute_url }}){:width="550px"}](https://link)

If you’ve got a [Sparkfun SAMD21 Mini](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13664) on hand, and you’d like to try it out with CircuitPython – you’re in luck! Shawn Hymel, engineer extraordinaire, just updated the [“Installing CircuitPython on SAMD21 Boards”](https://learn.adafruit.com/installing-circuitpython-on-samd21-boards/installing-circuitpython) guide to include instructions and board definitions for this cute red board. The most recent hot-off-the-press builds are available in our [S3 bucket here](https://adafruit-circuit-python.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html?prefix=bin/sparkfun_samd21_mini/). Try it out today! - [Adafruit](https://blog.adafruit.com/2019/01/10/circuitpython-on-sparkfun-samd21-mini-by-shawnhymel-adafruit-arduino-circuitpython-sparkfun/).

[Timothy Garcia](http://www.timothygarcia.ca) sent [this wonderful](https://blog.adafruit.com/2019/01/12/timothy-garcias-circuitpython-magazine-spread-eighthree/) CircuitPython magazine spread in, he writes "I just wanted to share a magazine spread design I did themed around CircuitPython for my final exam for InDesign CC at Uni. It was a four-hour exam but felt like fifteen minutes because I enjoyed working with the content. I took the photos from the Adafruit Flickr, It was a great resource ! Thank you and to the rest of the Adafruit team for serving as an inspiration to many of my design school projects." - [PDF](https://cdn-blog.adafruit.com/uploads/2019/01/timothygarcia-finalexam.pdf).

## CircuitPython in 2019

[![alt text]({{ "/assets/image_name" | absolute_url }}){:width="550px"}](https://link)

As 2018 comes to a close we like to reflect on how the year went and set goals for 2019. In the last two years ([2017](https://blog.adafruit.com/2017/01/09/welcome-to-the-adafruit-circuitpython-beta/), [2018](https://blog.adafruit.com/2018/01/29/circuitpython-in-2018/)) this has been a blog post by Scott (aka tannewt). For 2019, we’d like to do it a bit differently. This time we’d like everyone in the CircuitPython community to contribute by posting their thoughts to some public place on the Internet.

We’ll read these over the holidays and into the first half of January. After the January 14th CircuitPython weekly we’ll draft an overarching vision post for CircuitPython in 2019 and discuss it in the following meeting.

See [the blog post for more details](https://blog.adafruit.com/2018/12/17/what-do-you-want-from-circuitpython-in-2019-circuitpython2019-circuitpython/).

#ICYDNCI What was the most popular, most clicked link, in [last week's newsletter?](https://link) [title](url).

## Made with Mu

Why Mu? Mu tries to make it as easy as possible to get started with programming but aims to help you graduate to "real" development tools soon after. Everything in Mu is the "real thing" but presented in as simple and obvious way possible. It's like the toddling stage in learning to walk: you're finding your feet and once you're confident, you should move on and explore! Put simply, Mu aims to foster autonomy. Try out Mu today! - [codewith.mu](https://codewith.mu/)

## New Learn Guides!

[Python Debouncer Library for Buttons and Sensors](https://learn.adafruit.com/debouncer-library-python-circuitpython-buttons-sensors) from [Dave Astels](https://learn.adafruit.com/users/dastels)

[Spinning Disc Step Sequencer](https://learn.adafruit.com/spinning-disc-step-sequencer) from [John Park](https://learn.adafruit.com/users/johnpark)

## Updated Guides - Now With More Python!

**You can use CircuitPython libraries on Raspberry Pi!** We're updating all of our CircuitPython guides to show how to wire up sensors to your Raspberry Pi, and load the necessary CircuitPython libraries to get going using them with Python. We'll be including the updates here so you can easily keep track of which sensors are ready to go. Check it out!

Keep checking back for more updated guides!

## CircuitPython Libraries!

[![CircuitPython Libraries]({{ "/assets/22_1023blinka.png" | absolute_url }}){:width="418px"}](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/releases/latest)

CircuitPython support for hardware continues to grow. We are adding support for new sensors and breakouts all the time, as well as improving on the drivers we already have. As we add more libraries and update current ones, you can keep up with all the changes right here!

For the latest drivers, download the [Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/releases/latest).

If you'd like to contribute, CircuitPython libraries are a great place to start. Have an idea for a new driver? File an issue on [CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues)! Interested in helping with current libraries? Check out [this GitHub issue on CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues/1246) for an overview of the State of the CircuitPython Libraries, updated each week. We've included open issues from the library issue lists, and details about repo-level issues that need to be addressed. We have a guide on [contributing to CircuitPython with Git and Github](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github) if you need help getting started. You can also find us in the #circuitpython channel on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord). Feel free to contact Kattni (@kattni) with any questions.

You can check out this [list of all the CircuitPython libraries and drivers available](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/blob/master/circuitpython_library_list.md). 

The current number of CircuitPython libraries is **127**!

**New Libraries!**

Here's this week's new CircuitPython libraries:

* [Adafruit CircuitPython ADT7410](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_ADT7410)

* [Adafruit CircuitPython BoardTest](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_BoardTest)

**Updated Libraries!**

Here's this week's updated CircuitPython libraries:

* [Adafruit CircuitPython MAX31856](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_MAX31856)

**PyPI Download Stats!**

We've written a special library called Adafruit Blinka that makes it possible to use CircuitPython Libraries on [Raspberry Pi and other compatible single-board computers](https://learn.adafruit.com/circuitpython-on-raspberrypi-linux/). Adafruit Blinka and all the CircuitPython libraries have been deployed to PyPI for super simple installation on Linux! Here are the top 10 CircuitPython libraries downloaded from PyPI in the last week, including the total downloads for those libraries:

## Call for help – CircuitPython messaging to other languages!

[![Hello world]({{ "/assets/helloworld550.jpg" | absolute_url }}){:width="550px"}](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues/1098)

We [recently posted on the Adafruit blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2018/08/15/help-bring-circuitpython-messaging-to-other-languages-circuitpython/) about bringing CircuitPython messaging to other languages, one of the exciting features of CircuitPython 4.x is translated control and error messages. Native language messages will help non-native English speakers understand what is happening in CircuitPython even though the Python keywords and APIs will still be in English. If you would like to help, [please post](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues/1098) to the main issue on GitHub and join us on [Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

We made this graphic with translated text, we could use your help with that to make sure we got the text right, please check out the text in the image – if there is anything we did not get correct, please let us know. Dan sent me this [handy site too](http://helloworldcollection.de/#Human).
