[Latest Dose Of Hardware Talks Headed To Supercon - Hackaday](https://hackaday.com/2019/10/11/latest-dose-of-hardware-talks-headed-to-supercon/).

> The tickets have sold out even as the list of incredible speakers grows. Today we bring you the third dose of talks you’ll see at the [Hackaday Superconference](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/2019-hackaday-superconference-tickets-60129236164?aff=1004com) in November — whether you were lucky enough to grab a ticket, or will be watching the livestream, these eight will be speaking on topics from algorithmically-augmented live music performance to the hardware that captures the real world for display in VR and from leveraging the power of lookup tables to harnessing our engineering talent in a way that truly enriches humanity. If you missed the two speaker announcements that have already come out, [go back](https://hackaday.com/2019/09/27/heres-your-first-look-at-the-talks-of-the-2019-hackaday-superconference/) and [take a look](https://hackaday.com/2019/10/04/more-supercon-talks-taking-the-hardware-world-by-storm/) at those as well as [the workshops](https://hackaday.com/2019/10/02/get-hands-on-at-supercon-workshop-tickets-now-available-2/) being held during Supercon.

AND, big news!

**Supercharge Your Hardware (Old and New) with CircuitPython - Scott Shawcroft**

>_"CircuitPython makes programming hardware easier than ever by bringing the popular Python language to modern, inexpensive 32-bit microcontrollers. This doesn’t need to be limited to modern hardware though. By pairing a modern microcontroller running CircuitPython and a vintage computer, such as a GameBoy or Yamaha piano keyboard, you can unlock the unique characteristics of these vintage devices. In this talk, you’ll learn the basics of how CircuitPython makes coding easy, how it works under the hood, and how to extend CircuitPython with C. As an example, we’ll supercharge a Nintendo’s GameBoy with CircuitPython. By the end of the talk, you’ll be able to supercharge your own hardware project with CircuitPython."_

Adafruit will have some team members at Supercon and some special hardware surprises thanks to Digi-Key!

[AWS DeepRacer](https://aws.amazon.com/deepracer/) is an autonomous 1/18th scale race car driven by reinforcement learning, 3D racing simulator, and global racing league. You can build your own RL model for AWS DeepRacer using the AWS DeepRacer 3D racing simulator. Building a model requires basic Python programming skills. [We picked one up](https://blog.adafruit.com/2019/10/11/aws-deepracer-arrived-runs-on-python-adafruit-awscloud-awsdeepracer-deepracer/) and will get Blinka on it shortly.

## Python powered Mini PiTFT – 135×240 Color TFT Add-on for Raspberry Pi

[![ Mini PiTFT](../assets/10152019/101519MiniPiTFT.gif)](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4393)

Mini PiTFT – 135×240 Color TFT Add-on for Raspberry Pi – If you’re looking for the most compact li’l color display for a Raspberry Pi (most likely a Pi Zero) project, this might be just the thing you need!

[The Mini PiTFT – 135×240 Color TFT Add-on for Raspberry Pi](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4393) is your little TFT pal, ready to snap onto any and all Raspberry Pi computers, to give you a little display. The Mini PiTFT comes with a full color 240×135 pixel IPS display with great visibility at all angles. The TFT uses only the SPI port so its very fast, and we leave plenty of pins remaining available for buttons, LEDs, sensors, etc. It’s also nice and compact so it will fit into any case.

This display is super small, only about 1.14″ diagonal, but since it is an IPS display, its very readable with high contrast and visibility. We had a little space on the top so we give you two tactile buttons on GPIO pins so you can create a simple user interface. On the bottom we have a Qwiic/STEMMA QT connector for I2C sensors and device so you can plug and play any of our STEMMA QT devices.

Using the display is very easy, we have a kernel driver and Python library for the ST7789 chipset. You can set it up as a console output so you can have text and user interface through the Raspberry Pi OS or you draw images, text, whatever you like, using the Python imaging library. Our tests showed ~15 FPS update rates so you can do animations or simple video.

Comes completely pre-assembled and tested so you don’t need to do anything but plug it in and install our Python code! Works with any Raspberry Pi computer - [Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4393).
