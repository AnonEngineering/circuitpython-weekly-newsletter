## Upcoming events!

July 23rd to July 29th, 2018 is [EuroPython](https://ep2018.europython.eu/), a community conference with a [call for proposals until May 20th](https://ep2018.europython.eu/en/call-for-proposals/) on every aspect of Python: programming from novice to advanced levels, applications and frameworks, or how you have been involved in introducing Python into your organization.

August 24-28, 2018 is [PyCon.AU](https://2018.pycon-au.org/) in Sydney, Australia. It is the national Python conference for Australia and the home PyCon of MicroPython! Videos of past talks are [here](https://www.youtube.com/user/PyConAU).

## New Learn Guides!

[CircuitPython on Linux and Raspberry Pi](https://learn.adafruit.com/circuitpython-on-raspberrypi-linux?view=all). We have a new guide on interfacing hardware with sensors super easy using CircuitPython. We're always looking for ways to make making easier - whether that's making breakout boards for hard-to-solder sensors or writing libraries to simplify motor control.

For a couple years now we've had CircuitPython for microcontrollers like our SAMD21 series with Feather/Trinket/CircuitPlayground/Metro M0, as well as the ESP8266 WiFi microcontroller, nRF52 bluetooth microcontroller and SAMD51 series.

All of these chips have something in common - they are microcontrollers with hardware peripherals like SPI, I2C, ADCs etc. We squeeze Python into 'em and can then make the project portable.

But...sometimes you want to do more than a microcontroller can do. Like HDMI video output, or camera capture, or serving up a website, or just something that takes more memory and computing than a microcontroller board can do...
