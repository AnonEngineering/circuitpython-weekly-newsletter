## CRICKIT of the week!

Trash Panda "game" Made with CRICKIT & CircuitPython. [Code](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Learning_System_Guides/blob/master/Crickits/climbing_raccoon/code.py) & [video](https://youtu.be/OA4OsgxLPAQ). This Trash Panda, also known as a [raccoon](https://twitter.com/ubs/status/1006901737108770816), game uses capacitive touch, which move the trash panda up if you can climb fast enough and long enough. It moves the steppers, if you stop, the trash panda starts to fall. Don't let that happen. Door sensors detect the top and bottom, NeoPixels light up green for "doing good" or red for "better start climbing better!" When you get to the top, you are transformed and reach the next level of enlightenment.

## New Learn Guides!

[CircuitPython on Linux and Raspberry Pi](https://learn.adafruit.com/circuitpython-on-raspberrypi-linux?view=all). We have a new guide on interfacing hardware with sensors super easy using CircuitPython. We're always looking for ways to make making easier - whether that's making breakout boards for hard-to-solder sensors or writing libraries to simplify motor control.

For a couple years now we've had CircuitPython for microcontrollers like our SAMD21 series with Feather/Trinket/CircuitPlayground/Metro M0, as well as the ESP8266 WiFi microcontroller, nRF52 bluetooth microcontroller and SAMD51 series.

All of these chips have something in common - they are microcontrollers with hardware peripherals like SPI, I2C, ADCs etc. We squeeze Python into 'em and can then make the project portable.

But...sometimes you want to do more than a microcontroller can do. Like HDMI video output, or camera capture, or serving up a website, or just something that takes more memory and computing than a microcontroller board can do...

## Upcoming events!

July 23rd to July 29th, 2018 is [EuroPython](https://ep2018.europython.eu/), a community conference with a [call for proposals until May 20th](https://ep2018.europython.eu/en/call-for-proposals/) on every aspect of Python: programming from novice to advanced levels, applications and frameworks, or how you have been involved in introducing Python into your organization.

August 24-28, 2018 is [PyCon.AU](https://2018.pycon-au.org/) in Sydney, Australia. It is the national Python conference for Australia and the home PyCon of MicroPython! Videos of past talks are [here](https://www.youtube.com/user/PyConAU).
