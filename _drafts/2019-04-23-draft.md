## Updated Guides - Now With More Python!

**You can use CircuitPython libraries on Raspberry Pi!** We're updating all of our CircuitPython guides to show how to wire up sensors to your Raspberry Pi, and load the necessary CircuitPython libraries to get going using them with Python. We'll be including the updates here so you can easily keep track of which sensors are ready to go. Check it out!

Keep checking back for more updated guides!

## CircuitPython Libraries!

[![CircuitPython Libraries](../assets/04232019/4232019libs.png)](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/releases/latest)

CircuitPython support for hardware continues to grow. We are adding support for new sensors and breakouts all the time, as well as improving on the drivers we already have. As we add more libraries and update current ones, you can keep up with all the changes right here!

For the latest drivers, download the [Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/releases/latest).

If you'd like to contribute, CircuitPython libraries are a great place to start. Have an idea for a new driver? File an issue on [CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues)! Interested in helping with current libraries? Check out [this GitHub issue on CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues/1246) for an overview of the State of the CircuitPython Libraries, updated each week. We've included open issues from the library issue lists, and details about repo-level issues that need to be addressed. We have a guide on [contributing to CircuitPython with Git and Github](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github) if you need help getting started. You can also find us in the #circuitpython channel on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord). Feel free to contact Kattni (@kattni) with any questions.

You can check out this [list of all the CircuitPython libraries and drivers available](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/blob/master/circuitpython_library_list.md). 

The current number of CircuitPython libraries is **147**!

**New Libraries!**

Here's this week's new CircuitPython libraries:

* [Adafruit CircuitPython LPS35HW](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_LPS35HW)

**PyPI Download Stats!**

[![PyPI Download Stats](../assets/04232019/4232019tux.jpg)](https://learn.adafruit.com/circuitpython-on-raspberrypi-linux/)

We've written a special library called Adafruit Blinka that makes it possible to use CircuitPython Libraries on [Raspberry Pi and other compatible single-board computers](https://learn.adafruit.com/circuitpython-on-raspberrypi-linux/). Adafruit Blinka and all the CircuitPython libraries have been deployed to PyPI for super simple installation on Linux! Here are the top 10 CircuitPython libraries downloaded from PyPI in the last week, including the total downloads for those libraries:

## Upcoming events!

[![KiCon](../assets/04232019/42319kicon.png)](https://www.kicad-kicon.com)

Happening April 26th and 27th 2019 in Chicago IL, this will be the first and largest gathering of hardware developers using KiCad. Talks at the conference will span hardware design, revision control, scripting, manufacturing considerations, proper library management and getting  started developing the underlying tools. All talks have been listed on the conference site. Additionally, there will be contests, roundtable discussions with the developers and hands-on demos to deepen knowledge of hardware design and using KiCad.

Is this a conference only for current users of KiCad? No! Attendees will learn general concepts around PCB design, hardware creation and developing products for the market. Attendees include hardware and software developers from around the world, including members of the core KiCad development team out of CERN in Switzerland.

Attend this unconventional conference to learn more about how to build your next hardware project using open source, extensible tools. Join  industry figures (and sponsors) like Digikey, Adafruit, Supplyframe and Bantam Tools. Interact with manufacturing experts from OSHpark, Royal Circuits, Aisler and SnapEDA. Meet and get to know others in the hardware community, who regularly are creating new hardware for fun and profit - [kicad-kicon.com](https://www.kicad-kicon.com)

[![PyCon AU](../assets/04232019/42319pyconau2019.png)](https://2019.pycon-au.org/speak/)

PyCon AU has recently announced their [Call for Proposals](https://2019.pycon-au.org/speak/).

## Digi-Key + Adafruit @ PyCon!

[![PyCon](../assets/04232019/42319pycon.jpg)](https://blog.adafruit.com/2019/02/23/digi-key-and-adafruit-at-pycon-all-attendees-will-receive-a-circuit-playground-express-digikey-adafruit-pycon-pycon2019/)

PyCon 2019 returns May 1–9, 2019 to Cleveland, OH – with talks, tutorials, sprints, and more! 

[![PyCon](../assets/04232019/42319pycdigikey.jpg)](https://blog.adafruit.com/2019/02/23/digi-key-and-adafruit-at-pycon-all-attendees-will-receive-a-circuit-playground-express-digikey-adafruit-pycon-pycon2019/)

Big news! Digi-Key and Adafruit have teamed up for PyCon 2019 so every attendee (about 4,000!) will receive a [SPECIAL EDITION Circuit Playground Express](https://youtu.be/ZMx6qB-7z9U), running … CircuitPython.

[![PyCon](../assets/04232019/42319pyconboards.jpg)](https://blog.adafruit.com/2019/02/23/digi-key-and-adafruit-at-pycon-all-attendees-will-receive-a-circuit-playground-express-digikey-adafruit-pycon-pycon2019/)

This effort is to get Python on hardware to the most folks out there, at the events that bring people together.

This is just one of many efforts we’re teaming up with Digi-Key to continue to fuel all the developers from beginners to pro, using Python on microcontrollers.

[![PyCon](../assets/04232019/42319team.jpg)](https://blog.adafruit.com/2019/02/23/digi-key-and-adafruit-at-pycon-all-attendees-will-receive-a-circuit-playground-express-digikey-adafruit-pycon-pycon2019/)

What else is happening? The CircuitPython team will be running several Open Spaces sessions (as they did last year), showing how to use CircuitPython on the Digi-Key / Adafruit PyCon special edition Circuit Playground Express. We’ll have extra addons to play with also: potentiometers, NeoPixel strips, and servos. The team will be running a CircuitPython Sprint for several days to work on CircuitPython libraries and CircuitPython core code. BYOMUSB “Bring your own Micro USB” cables, we’ll have some to borrow during the sprints/sessions, as well as some USB C adapters, good idea to bring one too!

The PyCon 2019 conference, which will take place in Cleveland, is the largest annual gathering for the community using and developing the open-source Python programming language. It is produced and underwritten by the Python Software Foundation, the 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization dedicated to advancing and promoting Python. Through PyCon, the PSF advances its mission of growing the international community of Python programmers.

Scott will be leading a talk at the **Python Language Summit, History of CircuitPython**. The Python Language Summit is an event for the developers of Python implementations (CPython, PyPy, Jython, and so on) to share information, discuss our shared problems, and — hopefully — solve them - [pycon.org/2019/events/language-summit](https://us.pycon.org/2019/events/language-summit/)

We will have a lot more updates, stay tuned to the [Adafruit blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/category/circuitpython/), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/adafruit), [Discord](http://adafru.it/discord), and more!

## Call for help – CircuitPython messaging to other languages!

[![Hello World](../assets/04232019/4232019hello.jpg)](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues/1098)

We [posted on the Adafruit blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2018/08/15/help-bring-circuitpython-messaging-to-other-languages-circuitpython/) about bringing CircuitPython messaging to other languages, one of the exciting features of CircuitPython 4.x is translated control and error messages. Native language messages will help non-native English speakers understand what is happening in CircuitPython even though the Python keywords and APIs will still be in English. If you would like to help, [please post](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues/1098) to the main issue on GitHub and join us on [Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

We made this graphic with translated text, we could use your help with that to make sure we got the text right, please check out the text in the image – if there is anything we did not get correct, please let us know. Dan sent me this [handy site too](http://helloworldcollection.de/#Human).
