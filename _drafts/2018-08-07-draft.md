On [August 3, 2018](https://twitter.com/awesome__re/status/1025240714718797824) - [CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/awesome-circuitpython) was added to the [awesome list](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome), a community of curated awesome lists on GitHub. The maintainer took a break, however, they are back and if you want to help out, review at least 2 other open pull requests - [details here](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome/issues/1363). Additionally, [Sindre Sorhus](https://www.patreon.com/sindresorhus/overview) has a Patreon if you want to support all the open source efforts. Adafruit contributes to the Patreon.
