## News from around the web!

The Arduino MKR1300 board, ported to CircuitPython - [GitHub.](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/pull/1295) Thanks to community member [sabas1080](https://github.com/sabas1080) we now have a CircuitPython port for the SAMD21 MKR1300! Note that support for the LoRa CMWX1ZZABZ is not included yet, but this is an excellent start. Check out our [install guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/welcome-to-circuitpython/installing-circuitpython) for how to load CircuitPython.

Behind-the-Scenes curriculum of the CodeAcademy Hackathon featuring CircuitPython. Plug in and play, right on Codecademy. Ladyada and Phil at Adafruit suggested that CodeAcademy build a CircuitPython course so they are trying to make that happen. In this lesson, you will learn about Circuit Playground Express, the perfect introduction to electronics and programming. There is also a project where you build an “808” Drum Machine with… fruits! [The lesson](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/curriculum-hackathon-2018/lessons/learn-circuitpython/exercises/introduction/) and [projects](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/curriculum-hackathon-2018/projects/drum-machine/) are here along with an [overview.](https://news.codecademy.com/hackathon-behind-the-scenes/) [Vote here](https://codecademyready.typeform.com/to/sbAb32/) for CircuitPython!

## Updated Guides - Now With More Python!

**You can use CircuitPython on Raspberry Pi!** We're updating all of our CircuitPython guides to show how to wire up sensors to your Raspberry Pi, and load the necessary CircuitPython libraries to get going using them with Python. We'll be including the updates here so you can easily keep track of which sensors are ready to go. Check it out!

## CircuitPython Libraries!

[![CircuitPython Libraries]({{ "/assets/22_1023blinka.png" | absolute_url }}){:width="418px"}](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/releases/latest)

CircuitPython support for hardware continues to grow. We are adding support for new sensors and breakouts all the time, as well as improving on the drivers we already have. As we add more libraries and update current ones, you can keep up with all the changes right here!

For the latest drivers, download the [Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/releases/latest).

If you'd like to contribute, CircuitPython libraries are a great place to start. Have an idea for a new driver? File an issue on [CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues)! Interested in helping with current libraries? Check out [this GitHub issue on CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues/1246) for an overview of the State of the CircuitPython Libraries, updated each week. We've included open issues from the library issue lists, and details about repo-level issues that need to be addressed. We have a guide on [contributing to CircuitPython with Git and Github](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github) if you need help getting started. You can also find us in the #circuitpython channel on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord). Feel free to contact Kattni (@kattni) with any questions.

You can check out this [list of all the CircuitPython libraries and drivers available](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/blob/master/circuitpython_library_list.md). 

The current number of CircuitPython libraries is **105**!
