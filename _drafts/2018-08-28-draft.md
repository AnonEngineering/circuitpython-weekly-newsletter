On page 25 of [Microchip’s MicroSolutions](http://www.microchip.com/about-us/microsolutions-enewsletter), "Python on Microcontrollers" is the featured Design Corner article. MicroSolutions is Microchip’s bi-monthly digital magazine, delivering the latest new products and development tools, design articles on a wide range of topics and learn about some innovative ways Microchip devices are being used by developers of a variety of applications - [MicroSolutions September/October 2018, PDF.](http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/MicroSolutions_September_October_2018.pdf)

## FEATHER GETS 10 out of 10 in HACKSPACE

[![feather in hackspace]({{ "/assets/828feather.jpg" | absolute_url }}){:width="550px"}](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/rpi-magazines/issues/full_pdfs/000/000/018/original/HackSpaceMag10.pdf)

On page 117 of [HackSpace Magazine, issue 10](https://hackspace.raspberrypi.org/issues/10) there is a massive Adafruit Feather review (10 out 10!) ... "Don’t overlook the fact that it supports CircuitPython. This is a big deal, especially in the educational market. The board comes preloaded with the UF2 bootloader. This means all of your code can be dropped on the board, just like saving a file to a USB drive. No compiling, no uploading to the board, and more importantly, no drivers needed. It’s really simple and works on a wide array of computers." - [HackSpace Magazine Issue 10, PDF.](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/rpi-magazines/issues/full_pdfs/000/000/018/original/HackSpaceMag10.pdf)
