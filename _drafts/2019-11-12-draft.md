## Python powered badges at Hackaday Supercon

[![Supercon](../assets/11122019/111219hadbadges.jpg)](https://hackaday.io/superconference/)

Here are some of the details about the BrainCraft EDGE BADGE that is at [Supercon](https://hackaday.io/superconference/) this year brought to you by [Digi-Key](https://www.digikey.com/) and Adafruit! This is IN ADDITION to the [2019 Hackaday Superconference Badge](https://hackaday.io/project/167255-2019-hackaday-superconference-badge) - a FPGA Running RISC-V Core in a Game Boy form factor. Machine learning has come to the 'edge' - small microcontrollers that can run a very miniature version of TensorFlow Lite to do ML computations. But you don't need super complex hardware to start developing your own TensorFlow models! We've curated a simple kit to dip your toes into machine learning waters. This Supercon badge can also be a name badge that is programmed with CircuitPython, it shows up as USB drive, no IDE needed! Displays name, QR codes, and more! Supercon attendees receive:

*   Adafruit BrainCraft EDGE BADGE with SAMD51 Cortex M4F processor @ 120MHz, with display, speaker and buttons.
*   Lithium Ion Polymer Battery with Short Cable - 3.7V 350mAh, double sided tape, and lanyard!

The kit uses our BrainCraft EDGE BADGE as your edge processor. It's a compact board - it's credit card sized. It's powered by one of our favorite chip, the ATSAMD51, with 512KB of flash and 192KB of RAM. We add 2 MB of QSPI flash for file storage, handy for TensorFlow Lite files, images, fonts, sounds, or other assets. Comes with built in microphone input for micro speech recognition. Our Arduino library has some demos you can get started with to recognize various word pairs like "yes/no", "up/down" and "cat/dog" and other voice demos. Also includes gesture recognition, and more! TensorFlow Lite for microcontrollers is very cutting-edge so expect to see a lot of development happening in this area, with lots of code and process changes.

*   ATSAMD51J19 @ 120MHz with 3.3V logic/power - 512KB of FLASH + 192KB of RAM
*   2 MB of SPI Flash for storing images, sounds, animations, whatever!
*   1.8" 160x128 Color TFT Display connected to its own SPI port
*   8 x Game/Control Buttons with nice silicone button tops (these feel great)
*   5 x NeoPixels for badge dazzle, or game score-keeping
*   Triple-axis accelerometer (motion sensor)
*   Light sensor, reverse-mount so that it points out the front
*   Built in buzzer mini-speaker
*   Mono Class-D speaker driver for 4-8 ohm speakers, up to 2 Watts
*   LiPoly battery port with built in recharging capability
*   USB port for battery charging, programming and debugging
*   Two female header strips with Feather-compatible pinout so you can plug any FeatherWings in
*   JST ports for NeoPixels, sensor input, and I2C (you can fit I2C Grove connectors in here)
*   Built in microphone.

The following contributions to this week's newsletter are from [Matt](https://github.com/mattytrentini)! Thanks [Matt](https://twitter.com/matt_trentini)!

## New MicroPython Beginner Workshop 

MicroPython has a new [Beginner Workshop](https://micropython-workshop.readthedocs.io)! Based around the ESP32 and the readily-available Wemos shields (no breadboard, no wires!), this workshop aims to get beginners started using MicroPython on hardware *as soon as possible* and with a *low entry cost*. AUD$25 for the microcontroller, RGB LED shield, cable and small box.

[![MicroPython Workshop Beginner Kit](../assets/11122019/11122019micropython_workshop_beginner_kit.jpg)](https://micropython-workshop.readthedocs.io)

MicroPython recently presented this workshop material for the first time to a dozen PyLadies in Melbourne and we all had a blast making LEDs flash, bending OLEDs to our will and blaring the Mario tune out of buzzers! The PyLadies were *fantastic* students and we're already looking forward to a second workshop.

[![MicroPython Workshop presenting to PyLadies](../assets/11122019/11122019micropython_workshop_room.jpg)](https://github.com/mattytrentini/micropython_workshop)

If you'd like to run a workshop based on this material - or purchase beginner kits - please reach out to [Matt](https://twitter.com/matt_trentini) who'll help you get started. Pull requests are always welcome and if you're keen to [contribute to the material](https://github.com/mattytrentini/micropython_workshop) please do so!

Thanks to Deshipu for a hand getting started; the structure is based on Deshipu's (still excellent!) [MicroPython on ESP8266 Workshop](https://micropython-on-esp8266-workshop.readthedocs.io).

## MicroWebSrv2

[![MicroWebSrv2](../assets/11122019/11122019microWebSrv2.png)](https://github.com/jczic/MicroWebSrv2)

[Jean-Christophe Bos](https://github.com/jczic) is at it again; he's updated his popular and powerful embedded web server - [MicroWebSrv2](https://github.com/jczic/MicroWebSrv2).

It features an asynchronous architecture, has SSL/TLS support, supports web routes, web sockets and a template system - it's certainly feature-packed! One of the best features? Great documentation! MicroWebSrv2 is one of the best ways to embed a web server in MicroPython.

## MicroPython uLab

[![MicroPython ulab](../assets/11122019/11122019ulab.png)](https://github.com/v923z/micropython-ulab)

[Zoltán Vörös](https://github.com/v923z) recently released his [ulab library](https://github.com/v923z/micropython-ulab) for MicroPython. As featured in the Hackaday article [Numpy comes to MicroPython](https://hackaday.com/2019/10/29/numpy-comes-to-micro-python/), ulab is a numpy-like module for MicroPython, accelerating many mathmatical operations on embedded devices. Zoltán started the library wanting fast FFT operations but it's now expanded to include optimised linear and matrix operations, minipulation of polynomials and statistical functions. As well as being a powerful library, it also features [thorough documentation](https://micropython-ulab.readthedocs.io).

Fast math operations in the embedded Python space have been a common request for some time, now we've got something to build upon! Read more in the [MicroPython forum](https://forum.micropython.org/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=7005).

## MicroPython Developer Documentation

During Zoltán's efforts creating uLab, Zoltán also submitted some *excellent* [MicroPython developer documentation](https://micropython-usermod.readthedocs.io). Focusing on creating your own C user modules for MicroPython, it covers topics such as how to pass parameters across the language boundaries, error handling and profiling. This should be bookmarked by anyone interested in extending MicroPython with C!
