## CircuitPython editing and saving on iOS is here!

[![iOSPython](../assets/08062019/8619ipadYAY.jpg)](https://blog.adafruit.com/2019/07/30/its-now-possible-to-open-edit-and-save-python-code-on-ios-for-embedded-electronics-plugged-in-circuitpython-usb-devices-apple-ios-circuitpython/)

It’s now possible to open, edit, and save Python code on iOS for embedded electronics plugged in, CircuitPython USB devices. This is a follow up to [our post](https://blog.adafruit.com/2019/06/25/ios-13-beta-1-erases-files-off-drive-resets-ipad-fat12-issue-it-seems-apple/) about Apple’s iOS 13 beta, which is now up to beta 5.

The upcoming [iOS 13](https://www.apple.com/ios/ios-13-preview/) allows iPads (and iPhones) to be more like computers, which means you’ll be able to do computer-like things such as plugging in a USB drive, opening up the Files app in iOS 13 and browsing the files. This is going to be fantastic for folks who want to use an iPad as their full-time desktop replacement, and if you’re a coder it looks like you’ll be able to do things like opening up Python .py files, use IDEs for coding, etc. A lot of schools use iPads, so this means any iPad will be able to be used to code for electronics: if the app can open a text file, it can be used to write Python.

iOS 13 beta 1 had some troubles: it deleted files off some devices that act like USB drives, for example, all the CircuitPython boards. But now the GOOD NEWS: we filed a bug report, and since iOS beta 5 IT IS ALL WORKING! This means any code editor for iOS can be used as a code editor for CircuitPython and you’ll be able to open, edit, and save your code to the device(s) plugged in to the iOS device!

Here’s a quick summary of how to edit a CircuitPython file now on an iPad running iOS 13 beta 5: plug in a CircuitPython board, such as a Circuit Playground Express, select a file on CIRCUITPY, drag or copy/paste the file to “On My iPad”, use an editor to change the file, then delete the original file on CIRCUITPY, copy/paste, share, or drag the file back to CIRCUITPY, giving it a new name, rename and it all saves and runs automatically. It’s awesome. The code editing apps are not aware of this new “USB storage” in iOS 13 yet; when they are (soon), it will be even easier. For now, just use the iOS Files app to move the files around.

Also, iOS 13 beta 5 clearly still has some bugs: you can’t save the file with its original name, so you need to to save with a new name, delete the old file, and rename the new file.

## CircuitPython sneks its way to Snek!

[![Snek](../assets/08062019/8619snek.jpg)](https://circuitpython.org/board/snekboard/)

[![Snek](../assets/08062019/8619snek02.jpg)](https://circuitpython.org/board/snekboard/)

Snekboard is designed to hook up to Lego Power Functions motors and switches, allowing you to build robots out of Lego and control them with CircuitPython or the simpler snek programming language. Snekboard is 48mm × 48mm, which is the same size as 6 x 6 Lego studs allowing you to build a box out of Lego to hold it attached to your Leo design. It uses a single cell lithium polymer battery that fits under the board and charges over USB while snekboard is being programmed from the host - [circuitpython.org](https://circuitpython.org/board/snekboard/) & [keithhp.com](https://keithp.com/snek/snekboard/)

[![PyCon AU](../assets/08062019/8619pyconau.png)](https://2019.pycon-au.org/)

PyCon AU 2019 was/is August 2 - 6 2019, ICC Sydney. PyCon Australia (“PyCon AU”) is the national conference for the Python Programming Community, bringing together professional, student and enthusiast developers with a love for developing with Python. PyCon Australia informs the country’s Python developers with presentations, tutorials and panel sessions by experts and core developers of Python, as well as the libraries and frameworks that they rely on. Here are some of the Python on hardware talks!

[![PyCon AU](../assets/08062019/8619mpausn.jpg)](https://2019.pycon-au.org/)

**Micropython Gotchas**

We all somehow get the feeling that MicroPython is not quite the Python we know. During the talk, I’ll show what the “not quite” actually means. I’ll present a set of different issues I stumbled upon when working with different MicroPython powered boards ranging from memory constraints to API calls: By Michał Gałka - [pycon.au](https://2019.pycon-au.org/talks/micropython-gotchas).

**Extending MicroPython: Using C for good!***

MicroPython is a fantastic environment for embedded development. But it is an interpreted language; what happens when you hit performance limitations? Or want to use a new feature of your microcontroller? We’ll look at how MicroPython can be extended to add features and improve performance: By Matt Trentini - [pycon.au](https://2019.pycon-au.org/talks/extending-micropython-using-c-for-good)
