The Casio fx-CG50 Graphing Scientific Calculator, has Python functions added.  "The fx-CG50 comes built-in with Python, a programming language used in the development of Internet search engines, social media sites, robots, etc. Python is attracting attention in the field of education as a learning tool that cultivates algorithmic thinking and has been adopted for use in textbooks." The Python mode supports a version of MicroPython Version 1.9.4, which has been adapted to run on this calculator - [Casio.](http://edu.casio.com/products/graphic/fxcg50/#Python)

## "CircuitPython has changed the way I approach small projects"

"@CircuitPython has changed the way I approach small projects. Now it's as easy as dragging across a file and debugging in-situ on a client device without having to install an IDE. Absolute game-changer! And the @adafruit boards (M4/M0 express) are terrific!" - [Chris Fourie on Twitter.](https://twitter.com/no1089/status/1057990853229273088)

"#adafruit supplied this cool badge for #hackaday #superconference that runs #circuitpython.  Never used it before, got images displaying on it in 5 minutes.  Very nifty, worth learning more!" - [Mark VandeWettering on Twitter.](https://twitter.com/brainwagon/status/1058793735381610496)

Episode #184: Teaching Python with BBC micro:bit. How can we make learning Python and teaching Python more real for students, especially younger students? The BBC in the UK had a great idea. Make it more physically real with actual devices. That's where Nicholas Tollervey got involved. He helped bring the BBC Micro:bit and Python to millions of kids in the UK - [TalkPython Podcast.](https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/184/teaching-python-with-bbc-micro-bit)

## Updated Guides - Now With More Python!

**You can use CircuitPython on Raspberry Pi!** We're updating all of our CircuitPython guides to show how to wire up sensors to your Raspberry Pi, and load the necessary CircuitPython libraries to get going using them with Python. We'll be including the updates here so you can easily keep track of which sensors are ready to go. Check it out!

Check back next week for more CircuitPython on Raspberry Pi!

## CircuitPython Libraries!

[![CircuitPython Libraries]({{ "/assets/22_1023blinka.png" | absolute_url }}){:width="418px"}](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/releases/latest)

CircuitPython support for hardware continues to grow. We are adding support for new sensors and breakouts all the time, as well as improving on the drivers we already have. As we add more libraries and update current ones, you can keep up with all the changes right here!

For the latest drivers, download the [Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/releases/latest).

If you'd like to contribute, CircuitPython libraries are a great place to start. Have an idea for a new driver? File an issue on [CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues)! Interested in helping with current libraries? Check out [this GitHub issue on CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues/1246) for an overview of the State of the CircuitPython Libraries, updated each week. We've included open issues from the library issue lists, and details about repo-level issues that need to be addressed. We have a guide on [contributing to CircuitPython with Git and Github](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github) if you need help getting started. You can also find us in the #circuitpython channel on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord). Feel free to contact Kattni (@kattni) with any questions.

You can check out this [list of all the CircuitPython libraries and drivers available](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/blob/master/circuitpython_library_list.md). 

The current number of CircuitPython libraries is **105**!

## Upcoming events!

CT Hackerspace hosts ‚ÄòScaling Up with CircuitPython‚Äô FREE Workshop Thursday 11/15. Python is one of the most popular programming languages in the hobbyist community. It is easy to learn and has strong community support. It is used for a variety of tasks from AI to server administration and now even to run microcontrollers.

CircuitPython is becoming a great alternative to programming microcontrollers and is built specifically to do so. It simplifies the process of writing code for your board and gives quick results. We will be looking at programming the Adafruit Circuit Playground Express with CircuitPython. We will also take a look at what boards are available.

[CTHackerspace](http://www.cthackerspace.com/ct-hackerspace-hosts-scaling-up-with-circuitpython-free-workshop-thursday-11-15/) & [MeetUp.](https://www.meetup.com/CT-Hackerspace/events/256072526/)
