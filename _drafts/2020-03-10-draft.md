## What’s the team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Bryan**

This week I've been working on the libraries for the ICM-20948 9-DoF IMU from Invensense. 9-DoFs on one chip is pretty nice, so I'm hard at work getting this chip supported in Arduino and CircuitPython.

One interesting thing about this chip is that the magnetometer is a separate sensor with its own I2C address. It gets more interesting: similar to the LSM6DSOX and ICM330DH, this sensor has an external/master slave bus that it can use to communicate with and get data from other sensors. Normally this would be an interesting but ultimately situational feature, however in the case if the ICM-20948 this magnetometer is _on the external bus_. This means that getting all 9 DoFs requires setting up registers in the ICM20948 to configure the magnetometer and then map its output to another register! It was a bit tricky to figure out but there is a good reference library written by the folks at SparkFun that I was able to use to figure out the S33KR3T C0D3 to get the magnetometer configured properly.

Next up I'll be working on the tester code which will require me to add a few more bells and whistles to the Arduino library to test all the pins without needing to have a convoluted testing setup. Once the hardware is fully verified, I'll move onto the CircuitPython library which should be fairly straightforward now that I've figured things out while writing the Arduino library.

CircuitPython 5.0.0 stable is released! 5.0.0-rc.0 came out a week ago. The build process was failing to upload all the board builds to GitHub reliably; the GitHub release pages are not really designed for the over 1700 release assets we now have per build. For rc.0 I upload the missing builds manually  I then arranged for circuitpython.org to point to our Amazon S3 downloads site, which handles the bulk uploads much more easily . I released 5.0.0-rc.1 over the weekend to test the new downloads, and included a few i.MX fixes as well. The 5.0.0-rc.1 release seemed fine, so I made the 5.0.0 stable release on Monday. This is a huge milestone! Thanks to everyone who has worked on or tested 5.0.0 since we started working on it last July.

This week I'm going to be reverse engineering the radio traffic of a couple of BLE-enabled BBQ thermometers to see if we can figure out how to communicate with them. I also have several issues with the UF2 bootloader to look at and debug.

Subsequent to the 5.0.0 release, the pull request to add ulab to CircuitPython was incorporated.  This paves the way for an upcoming release, probably 5.1.0, to include it for most SAMD51 and nRF52840 based boards that support CircuitPython.  You can get it right now by using the "absolute newest" downloads from CircuitPython.org, and the ulab docs are also live on readthedocs.

This will be a boon for many types of number crunching routines in Python.  For example, converting the "normalized_rms" function from an existing guide took just a few minutes, and performs about 10x faster.  Drop us a note on Discord if you know of a library or guide that could be improved by the use of ulab.

**Kattni**

This week I published a guide for the [CLUE Custom Badge](https://learn.adafruit.com/clue-custom-circuit-python-badge)!

[![Kattni - CLUE Badge](../assets/03102020/03102020kattni.jpg)](https://circuitpython.org/)

The new custom badge feature of the Adafruit CircuitPython Pybadger library makes it super simple to display lines of text over a color-block or image background. The guide includes an example of creating a custom badge for CLUE that shows your twitter handle, name, job title, and pronoun. As well, it covers everything you can customise about the badge and how to do it. If you're looking to create a super customisable badge for your next event using your Adafruit CLUE, this guide has you covered!

This project is also part of [PyCon 2020](https://us.pycon.org/2020/) preparation. [Adafruit and Digi-Key are pairing up to sponsor PyCon](https://blog.adafruit.com/2020/02/06/get-a-clue-at-pycon-us-from-digi-key-and-adafruit-digikey-adafruit-pycon2020-pycon-circuitpython/) and provide a CLUE to every attendee. Now it will be easy to create a custom badge to show off during the conference on your new CLUE.

This past week I wrapped up my work on PulseOut and my Zephyr learn guide, and moved on to working on PulseIn (the IR pulse detection module for Circuitpython) and researching/preliminary work on the H7 and F7 processors offered by ST. I'm especially excited about these new MCUs given their use on boards like OpenMV - machine vision is something I enjoy tinkering with on my personal projects, and the opportunity to open up Circuitpython to these kinds of modules is very exciting. 

It'll also be fun to see Circuitpython on some of the most powerful chips offered in the Cortex M4/M7 market. I'll be quick to retry all the projects that have been sluggish for me in the past, and see how they perform on a system running at 400MHz!

**Melissa**

[![Melissa](../assets/03102020/03102020melissa.gif)](https://circuitpython.org/)

This past week I finished up the Web Bluetooth dashboard and added a few more services such as being able to change the color of the Neopixels, being able to manipulate a 3D Model on screen and playing a tone from the board. In addition, the Feather Bluefruit Sense came out and it worked great with the dashboard. I also added some more polish to application such as throttling the Frames per Second so it worked smoother.

After finishing that up, I wrote up a guide on using the dashboard. You can check the guide out at: https://learn.adafruit.com/using-connection-based-web-bluetooth-in-chrome. Next I'll be working on a version of the dashboard that works by monitoring BLE advertisements.

**Scott**

I was in Colorado at the end of the week. Thursday I visited SparkFun and met up with Great Scott Gadget folks to chat about CircuitPython. Thanks to everyone for taking the time to chat!

When I got back I had some email catch up to do and then helped a bit with releasing CircuitPython 5.0.0! Please update and let us know how it goes!

I've also been helping with the BroadcastNet demos that JohnPark has been doing.

The rest of this week I'm heads down on optimizing CircuitPython's power consumption so that BroadcastNet sensors and conference badges last longer on their battery charges. The main goal is to make `time.sleep()` actually go into a low power state. I think I can reduce the power consumption during sleep by a factor of 10 so that should be handy.
