## Native MP3 decoding/playback in CircuitPython

[![Mp3yon](../assets/12032019/12319mp3blinka.jpg)](https://youtu.be/4xh_mPaYG3s)

We’re testing out a new PR in CircuitPython by JEpler. This one adds native MP3 decoding – no playback chip required! Thanks to the patent expiration, we can now distribute MP3 decoding and its a great way to support compressed audio playback. We can even play 2 mp3’s at once. More than that isn’t possible yet due to RAM constraints. I’m testing an nRF52840 BLE feather with I2S. We’ll also try SAMD51 next. SAMD21 won’t be able to do it, due to the RAM requirements - [YouTube](https://youtu.be/4xh_mPaYG3s).

## Circuitpython snakes its way to Fomu

[![Fomu](../assets/12032019/12319foum.jpg)](https://github.com/xobs/circuitpython/releases)

Want Python in your USB port? Try the beta of CircuitPython for Fomu! Full USB support thanks to the new eptri USB port, and the awesome TinyUSB library. Binaries and instructions are here - v0.1.1-fomu: Beta Release 2 - [GitHub](https://github.com/xobs/circuitpython/releases). AND xobs has a cool post about making a profiler for optimization too - [xobs.io](https://xobs.io/cobbled-together-profiler/)

## NXP i.MX RT family takes flight with Feather and CircuitPython!

[![NXP](../assets/12032019/12319nxp.jpg)](https://twitter.com/arturo182/status/1199841134253682690)

[![NXP](../assets/12032019/12319nxp2.jpg)](https://twitter.com/arturo182/status/1199841134253682690)

CircuitPython snakes its way to the  powerful NXP i.MX RT family of MCUs, 500+ MHz and up to 1 MB RAM. Arturo is working on 2 Feathers: RT1011 + ESP32, and RT1062 with more GPIOs broken out (including the LCD interface) and a SD card - [Twitter](https://twitter.com/arturo182/status/1199841134253682690).

We'll be including the updates here so you can easily keep track of which sensors are ready to go. Check it out!

Keep checking back for more updated guides!

## CircuitPython Libraries!

[![CircuitPython Libraries](../assets/12032019/12319blinka.png)](https://circuitpython.org/libraries)

CircuitPython support for hardware continues to grow. We are adding support for new sensors and breakouts all the time, as well as improving on the drivers we already have. As we add more libraries and update current ones, you can keep up with all the changes right here!

For the latest drivers, download the [Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries).

If you'd like to contribute, CircuitPython libraries are a great place to start. Have an idea for a new driver? File an issue on [CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues)! Interested in helping with current libraries? Check out the [CircuitPython.org Contributing page](https://circuitpython.org/contributing). We've included open pull requests and issues from the libraries, and details about repo-level issues that need to be addressed. We have a guide on [contributing to CircuitPython with Git and Github](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github) if you need help getting started. You can also find us in the #circuitpython channel on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord). Feel free to contact Kattni (@kattni) with any questions.

You can check out this [list of all the CircuitPython libraries and drivers available](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/blob/master/circuitpython_library_list.md). 

The current number of CircuitPython libraries is **196**!

## Call for help – CircuitPython messaging to other languages!

[![Hello world](../assets/12032019/12319helloworld.jpg)](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues/1098)

We [recently posted on the Adafruit blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2018/08/15/help-bring-circuitpython-messaging-to-other-languages-circuitpython/) about bringing CircuitPython messaging to other languages, one of the exciting features of CircuitPython 4.x is translated control and error messages. Native language messages will help non-native English speakers understand what is happening in CircuitPython even though the Python keywords and APIs will still be in English. If you would like to help, [please post](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues/1098) to the main issue on GitHub and join us on [Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

We made this graphic with translated text, we could use your help with that to make sure we got the text right, please check out the text in the image – if there is anything we did not get correct, please let us know. Dan sent me this [handy site too](http://helloworldcollection.de/#Human).

## Codecademy "Learn Hardware Programming with CircuitPython"

[![Codecademy CircuitPython](../assets/12032019/12319codecademy_python.png)](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-circuitpython?utm_source=adafruit&utm_medium=partners&utm_campaign=circuitplayground&utm_content=pythononhardwarenewsletter)

Codecademy, an online interactive learning platform used by more than 45 million people, has teamed up with the leading manufacturer in STEAM electronics, Adafruit Industries, to create a coding course, "Learn Hardware Programming with CircuitPython". The course is now available in the [Codecademy catalog](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-circuitpython?utm_source=adafruit&utm_medium=partners&utm_campaign=circuitplayground&utm_content=pythononhardwarenewsletter).

Python is a highly versatile, easy to learn programming language that a wide range of people, from visual effects artists in Hollywood to mission control at NASA, use to quickly solve problems. But you don’t need to be a rocket scientist to accomplish amazing things with it. This new course introduces programmers to Python by way of a microcontroller — CircuitPython — which is a Python-based programming language optimized for use on hardware.

CircuitPython’s hardware-ready design makes it easier than ever to program a variety of single-board computers, and this course gets you from no experience to working prototype faster than ever before. Codecademy’s interactive learning environment, combined with Adafruit's highly rated Circuit Playground Express, present aspiring hardware hackers with a never-before-seen opportunity to learn hardware programming seamlessly online.

Whether for those who are new to programming, or for those who want to expand their skill set to include physical computing, this course will have students getting familiar with Python and creating incredible projects along the way. By the end, students will have built their own bike lights, drum machine, and even a moisture detector that can tell when it's time to water a plant.

Visit Codecademy to access the [Learn Hardware Programming with CircuitPython](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-circuitpython?utm_source=adafruit&utm_medium=partners&utm_campaign=circuitplayground&utm_content=pythononhardwarenewsletter) course and Adafruit to purchase a [Circuit Playground Express](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3333).

Codecademy has helped more than 45 million people around the world upgrade their careers with technology skills. The company’s online interactive learning platform is widely recognized for providing an accessible, flexible, and engaging experience for beginners and experienced programmers alike. Codecademy has raised a total of $43 million from investors including Union Square Ventures, Kleiner Perkins, Index Ventures, Thrive Capital, Naspers, Yuri Milner and Richard Branson, most recently raising its $30 million Series C in July 2016.
