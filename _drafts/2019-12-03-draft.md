## Native MP3 decoding/playback in CircuitPython

[![Mp3yon](../assets/12032019/12319mp3blinka.jpg)](https://youtu.be/4xh_mPaYG3s)

We’re testing out a new PR in CircuitPython by JEpler. This one adds native MP3 decoding – no playback chip required! Thanks to the patent expiration, we can now distribute MP3 decoding and its a great way to support compressed audio playback. We can even play 2 mp3’s at once. More than that isn’t possible yet due to RAM constraints. I’m testing an nRF52840 BLE feather with I2S. We’ll also try SAMD51 next. SAMD21 won’t be able to do it, due to the RAM requirements - [YouTube](https://youtu.be/4xh_mPaYG3s).

## Circuitpython snakes its way to Fomu thanks to TinyUSB

Codecademy, an online interactive learning platform used by more than 45 million people, has teamed up with the leading manufacturer in STEAM electronics, Adafruit Industries, to create a coding course, "Learn Hardware Programming with CircuitPython". The course is now available in the [Codecademy catalog](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-circuitpython?utm_source=adafruit&utm_medium=partners&utm_campaign=circuitplayground&utm_content=pythononhardwarenewsletter).

Python is a highly versatile, easy to learn programming language that a wide range of people, from visual effects artists in Hollywood to mission control at NASA, use to quickly solve problems. But you don’t need to be a rocket scientist to accomplish amazing things with it. This new course introduces programmers to Python by way of a microcontroller — CircuitPython — which is a Python-based programming language optimized for use on hardware.

CircuitPython’s hardware-ready design makes it easier than ever to program a variety of single-board computers, and this course gets you from no experience to working prototype faster than ever before. Codecademy’s interactive learning environment, combined with Adafruit's highly rated Circuit Playground Express, present aspiring hardware hackers with a never-before-seen opportunity to learn hardware programming seamlessly online.

Whether for those who are new to programming, or for those who want to expand their skill set to include physical computing, this course will have students getting familiar with Python and creating incredible projects along the way. By the end, students will have built their own bike lights, drum machine, and even a moisture detector that can tell when it's time to water a plant.
