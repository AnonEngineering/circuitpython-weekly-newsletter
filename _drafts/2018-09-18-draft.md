## Coming Soon! Python powered Pi accessories

We'd like to see a Raspberry Pi use LoRa and came up with this Radio+OLED bonnet: you get a radio module, 128x32 OLED, three buttons, and a variety of antenna pads.

And the Crickit for Raspberry Pi is almost ready too :)

Both of these will have CircuitPython code when we ship.
