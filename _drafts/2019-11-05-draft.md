## Take Flight with Feather - Hackaday and Digi-Key

[![Take Flight with Feather](../assets/11052019/11519takeflight.png)](https://hackaday.io/contest/168107-take-flight-with-feather)

The Adafruit Feather is the latest platform for microcontroller development, and companies like Particle, Sparkfun, and Seeed Studios are producing Feather-compatible devices for development and prototyping. Now it’s your turn. Design a board to fit in the Feather ecosystem and we’ll manufacture it. The best project in the Take Flight With Feather contest will be sent off to pick and place machines and head straight to the Digi-Key warehouse!

To get started, take a look at the current [Feather ecosystem](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-feather/community-feathers-wings) and get acquainted with the [GitHub repo filled with examples and tutorials](https://github.com/adafruit/awesome-feather).

For the Take Flight With Feather contest, we’re looking for the cool, the useful, the insane, and the practical. Most of all, we’re looking for manufacturability. Electron savant Lady Ada will be judging each board on the basis of manufacturability, with the best board moving on to the assembly line where it will be stocked at Digi-Key.

**What’s a good design? We’re looking for submissions in the following categories:**

*   The Weirdest Feather — What’s the most ridiculous expansion board you can come up with?
*   You’ll Cut Yourself On That Edge — We’re surrounded with bleeding-edge tech, what’s the coolest use of new technology?
*   Retro Feather — Old tech lives on, but can you design a Feather to interact with it? Is it even possible to build a vampire Ethernet tap or an old acoustically-coupled modem?
*   Assistive Tech — Build a Feather to help others. Use technology to improve lives.
*   Wireless Feather — Add a new wireless technology to the Feather ecosystem.

The winning entry overall will be chosen for manufacturability, and will win a small manufacturing run of 100 boards or less and be stocked at Digi-Key. The number of boards in the manufacturing run will be determined by the winning design. Note: Because of the small run initially, there will be no profit or margin for the first few boards. If the board is well accepted and a larger run is planned, then a longer term business model will be addressed. The 5 winners in the 5 categories above will receive $100 Tindie gift certificates. To get started, start a project on [hackaday.io](http://hackaday.io) and upload your project. Contest runs noon November 1 to noon December 31st. All times are in Pacific Standard Time.

Stop by [hackaday.io for more details](https://hackaday.io/contest/168107-take-flight-with-feather)!

## "maintainable code is more important than clever code"

[![Guido](../assets/11052019/11519guido_featured.png)](https://blog.dropbox.com/topics/company/thank-you--guido)

Python creator Guido van Rossum is retiring from DropBox, this is a great quote -

>_"...in 2013, Guido joined Dropbox. Since then, he has not only made contributions to Python at Dropbox, but also left an everlasting impact on our engineering culture and our people. It started with some of the young engineers Guido met early on. “There was a small number of really smart, really young coders who produced a lot of very clever code that only they could understand,” said van Rossum. “That is probably the right attitude to have when you're a really small startup.” But as the company grew, new engineers who joined couldn’t understand the code. Clever code is usually short and cryptic, written by and for the individual who came up with it, but is hard for anyone else to understand—and nearly impossible to maintain. Guido called this “cowboy coding culture”. He recognized its value in our early stages of trying to implement things quickly, but knew it wouldn’t be sustainable over time, so he decided to speak up in his own quiet way. “When asked, I would give people my opinion that maintainable code is more important than clever code,” he said. “If I encountered clever code that was particularly cryptic, and I had to do some maintenance on it, I would probably rewrite it. So I led by example, and also by talking to other people.”_

Thank you, Guido By [Dropbox Team](https://blog.dropbox.com/topics/company/thank-you--guido).

>_"Here is my official entry to Tech-nic-Allie's #HackAPumpkin challenge: Spoopy Poopy, the Farting Pumpkin. I can disgust those Trick-or-Treaters with this wonderfully flatulent trick--now with fart-flavored fragrance! This ceramic gourd is stuffed with electronics to emit light, sound, fog, and a little bit of stink. A passive infrared (PIR) sensor detects the presence of warm bodies and triggers the whole fart sequence. An Adafruit Feather M0 Express running #CircuitPython controls the lights (NeoPixels) and plays an audio clip out through pin A0. The fog machine is a vape pen loaded with half fog juice and half liquid fart. You've been warned: it's smelly."_
