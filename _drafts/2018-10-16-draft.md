## Python Developers Survey 2018

Once again PyCharm creators, JetBrains, has teamed up with the Python Software Foundation to conduct a survey of Python developers. Last year's survey yielded [many interesting insights](https://www.jetbrains.com/research/python-developers-survey-2017/). So, they are doing another survey this year. Everyone is encouraged to [fill it out](https://surveys.jetbrains.com/s3/c7-python-developers-survey-2018).

## Hacktoberfest!

Digital Ocean is once again encouraging open source contributions with limited edition T-Shirts. Even if you don't want one, now is a great time to start contributing to open source projects like [CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython), [its libraries](https://github.com/adafruit/?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=Adafruit_CircuitPython&type=&language=),  [MicroPython](https://github.com/micropython/micropython) or [Python](https://github.com/python/cpython). Check [this list](https://github.com/search?q=label%3Ahacktoberfest+state%3Aopen+type%3Aissue+user%3Aadafruit) for good first issues to start with on Adafruit repos, join [on Digital Ocean](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) to track your progress towards a shirt, and jump onto [our Discord chat](https://adafru.it/discord) to join others who contribute!

## Updated Guides - Now With More Python!

**You can use CircuitPython on Raspberry Pi!** We're updating all of our CircuitPython guides to show how to wire up sensors to your Raspberry Pi, and load the necessary CircuitPython libraries to get going using them with Python. We'll be including the updates here so you can easily keep track of which sensors are ready to go. Check it out!

## CircuitPython Libraries!

CircuitPython support for hardware continues to grow. We are adding support for new sensors and breakouts all the time, as well as improving on the drivers we already have. As we add more libraries and update current ones, you can keep up with all the changes right here!

For the latest drivers, download the [Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/releases/latest).

If you'd like to contribute, CircuitPython libraries are a great place to start. Have an idea for a new driver? File an issue on [CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues)! Interested in helping with current libraries? Check out [this GitHub issue on CircuitPython](UPDATEWITHURL) for an overview of the State of the CircuitPython Libraries, updated each week. We've included open issues from the library issue lists, and details about repo-level issues that need to be addressed. We have a guide on [contributing to CircuitPython with Git and Github](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github) if you need help getting started. You can also find us in the #circuitpython channel on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord). Feel free to contact Kattni (@kattni) with any questions.

The current number of CircuitPython libraries is **103**!
