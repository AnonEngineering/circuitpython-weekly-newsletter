## CircuitPython 4.0.0 Beta 7 released!

[![CircuitPython 4.0.0 Beta 7 released](../assets/04162019/)](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/releases/tag/4.0.0-beta.7)

We are nearing the end of the betas of 4.0.0, and hope this will be the last beta. There are still [a few issues to fix before stable](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%224.0.0+-+Bluetooth%22). We think the API's are now stable. Please use the latest 3.x stable release [(available from the new website!)](https://circuitpython.org/downloads) when first starting with CircuitPython. It is stable.

When you find a bug please [check the current known issues](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues) and [file an issue](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues/new) if something isn't already known.

Downloads are now available from [circuitpython.org](https://circuitpython.org)! This site makes it much easier to select the correct file and language for your board. The downloads page is [here](https://circuitpython.org/downloads).

**4.0.0**
4.0.0 is the latest major revision of CircuitPython. It features:
- extensive new support for pixel-based displays (`displayio`)
- a port to the Nordic nRF52840 microcontroller, including support as a BLE beacon or peripheral (`bleio`)
- USB MIDI support
- messages translated into multiple languages

## CircuitPython snakes its way to Gamebuino! 

[![Gamebunio](../assets/04162019/)](https://blog.adafruit.com/2019/04/09/circuitpython-snakes-its-way-to-gamebuino-thegamebuino-circuitpython-circuitpython-python/)

[Learn Python easily - Gamebuino](https://gamebuino.com/python) *"Learning to code in Python is soon possible with Gamebuino!"*

> Python is a easy to learn language, thanks to the readability of its code and the simplicity of use. It's an "interpreted" language, in other words you can execute it without compiling it. Not need to install another software, a simple text editor is enough! But simplicity does not mean a lack of possibilities! If it's one of the preferred languages to learn programming (the Académie Française has chosen the Python language for the new high school reform), it also allows the creation of advanced programs, and many big companies use it for their applications: YouTube, Spotify, and even NASA claim its use! ... If the final objective of Gamebuino (the creation of a game) is playful, we have put all our energy into making it a way for discovering the programming and becoming the ideal tool for learning Python.

## Resurrections from Celeste - GameBoys running CircuitPython

[![Resurrections from Celeste](../assets/04162019/)](https://youtu.be/uruvgVJNg_g)

[Scott's](https://twitter.com/tannewt/status/1116046843815714816) GameBoy orchestra sounds great! MIDI is coming from the computer into the black GameBoy pocket. CircuitPython running in the cart processes it and then queues the sounds in the GameBoy. Any notes the first GameBoy can't play will be forwarded on to the next (blue) and then the DMG. Thanks to [Playful Piano](https://www.ninsheetmusic.org/forum/index.php?topic=9946) for the MIDI file. Thanks to [Lena Raine](https://radicaldreamland.bandcamp.com/) for the wonderful Celeste soundtrack and to the Celeste crew for an amazing game. Support them by buying the game and soundtrack - [YouTube](https://youtu.be/uruvgVJNg_g).

> _Python, the fastest-growing major programming language, has risen in the ranks of programming languages in our survey yet again, edging out Java this year and standing as the second most loved language (behind Rust)... For the seventh year in a row, JavaScript is the most commonly used programming language, but Python has risen in the ranks again. This year, Python just edged out Java in overall ranking, much like it surpassed C# last year and PHP the year before. Python is the fastest-growing major programming language today... Python is the most wanted language for the third year in a row, meaning that developers who do not yet use it say they want to learn it._

## Updated Guides - Now With More Python!

**You can use CircuitPython libraries on Raspberry Pi!** We're updating all of our CircuitPython guides to show how to wire up sensors to your Raspberry Pi, and load the necessary CircuitPython libraries to get going using them with Python. We'll be including the updates here so you can easily keep track of which sensors are ready to go. Check it out!

Keep checking back for more updated guides!

## CircuitPython Libraries!

[![CircuitPython Libraries](../assets/04162019/)](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/releases/latest)

CircuitPython support for hardware continues to grow. We are adding support for new sensors and breakouts all the time, as well as improving on the drivers we already have. As we add more libraries and update current ones, you can keep up with all the changes right here!

For the latest drivers, download the [Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/releases/latest).

If you'd like to contribute, CircuitPython libraries are a great place to start. Have an idea for a new driver? File an issue on [CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues)! Interested in helping with current libraries? Check out [this GitHub issue on CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues/1246) for an overview of the State of the CircuitPython Libraries, updated each week.

[![KiCon](../assets/04192019/)](https://www.kicad-kicon.com)

Happening April 26th and 27th 2019 in Chicago IL, this will be the first and largest gathering of hardware developers using KiCad. Talks at the conference will span hardware design, revision control, scripting, manufacturing considerations, proper library management and getting  started developing the underlying tools. All talks have been listed on the conference site. Additionally, there will be contests, roundtable discussions with the developers and hands-on demos to deepen knowledge of hardware design and using KiCad.

Is this a conference only for current users of KiCad? No! Attendees will learn general concepts around PCB design, hardware creation and developing products for the market. Attendees include hardware and software developers from around the world, including members of the core KiCad development team out of CERN in Switzerland.

Attend this unconventional conference to learn more about how to build your next hardware project using open source, extensible tools. Join  industry figures (and sponsors) like Digikey, Adafruit, Supplyframe and Bantam Tools. Interact with manufacturing experts from OSHpark, Royal Circuits, Aisler and SnapEDA. Meet and get to know others in the hardware community, who regularly are creating new hardware for fun and profit - [kicad-kicon.com](https://www.kicad-kicon.com)

This effort is to get Python on hardware to the most folks out there, at the events that bring people together.

This is just one of many efforts we’re teaming up with Digi-Key to continue to fuel all the developers from beginners to pro, using Python on microcontrollers.

What else is happening? The CircuitPython team will be running several Open Spaces sessions (as they did last year), showing how to use CircuitPython on the Digi-Key / Adafruit PyCon special edition Circuit Playground Express. We’ll have extra addons to play with also: potentiometers, NeoPixel strips, and servos. The team will be running a CircuitPython Sprint for several days to work on CircuitPython libraries and CircuitPython core code. BYOMUSB “Bring your own Micro USB” cables, we’ll have some to borrow during the sprints/sessions, as well as some USB C adapters, good idea to bring one too!

The PyCon 2019 conference, which will take place in Cleveland, is the largest annual gathering for the community using and developing the open-source Python programming language. It is produced and underwritten by the Python Software Foundation, the 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization dedicated to advancing and promoting Python. Through PyCon, the PSF advances its mission of growing the international community of Python programmers.

Scott will be leading a talk at the **Python Language Summit, History of CircuitPython**. The Python Language Summit is an event for the developers of Python implementations (CPython, PyPy, Jython, and so on) to share information, discuss our shared problems, and — hopefully — solve them - [pycon.org/2019/events/language-summit](https://us.pycon.org/2019/events/language-summit/)

We will have a lot more updates, stay tuned to the [Adafruit blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/category/circuitpython/), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/adafruit), [Discord](http://adafru.it/discord), and more!

## Call for help – CircuitPython messaging to other languages!

[![Hellow World](../assets/04192019/)](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues/1098)

We [posted on the Adafruit blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2018/08/15/help-bring-circuitpython-messaging-to-other-languages-circuitpython/) about bringing CircuitPython messaging to other languages, one of the exciting features of CircuitPython 4.x is translated control and error messages. Native language messages will help non-native English speakers understand what is happening in CircuitPython even though the Python keywords and APIs will still be in English. If you would like to help, [please post](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues/1098) to the main issue on GitHub and join us on [Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

We made this graphic with translated text, we could use your help with that to make sure we got the text right, please check out the text in the image – if there is anything we did not get correct, please let us know. Dan sent me this [handy site too](http://helloworldcollection.de/#Human).
