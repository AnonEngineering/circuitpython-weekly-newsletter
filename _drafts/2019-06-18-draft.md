## The need for speed, CircuitPython 4.1.0 Beta 0 Released!

[![CircuitPython 4.1.0 Beta 0](../assets/06182019/)](https://circuitpython.org/downloads)

[CircuitPython 4.1.0 Beta 0 Released](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/releases/tag/4.1.0-beta.0)! 4.1.0’s biggest feature is speed! General execution of Python should be 2-5x faster and display refreshing will be faster as well.

This is the first beta version for testing. It shouldn’t break any code compatible with previous 4.x releases. Please use the latest 4.x stable release (available from the new website!) when first starting with CircuitPython. It is stable.

Download it now from [circuitpython.org](https://circuitpython.org/downloads) - [full release notes](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/releases/tag/4.1.0-beta.0).

## Console-based serial terminal for Windows/Visual Studio Code

[![VS Terminal](../assets/06182019/61819simplyserial.png)](https://forums.adafruit.com/viewtopic.php?f=60&t=152894)

[From the CircuitPython forums](https://forums.adafruit.com/viewtopic.php?f=60&t=152894), Fasteddy516 writes -

*_I've written a simple serial terminal in C# that runs as a Windows Console application (i.e. in command prompt or powershell). It should work with most devices that show up as "COMx" in Device Manager, but I wrote it specifically to work in a terminal window in Visual Studio Code with CircuitPython devices. It includes COM port auto detection, automatic re-connection (if you disconnect and reconnect your device), and uses USB VID and PID values to identify and give preference to CircuitPython-capable devices. The idea was to get a serial monitor in VSCode that was as simple and functional as the serial monitor in the Mu editor. (I like the Mu editor quite a bit, but I do a lot of other work in Visual Studio Code and found switching between the two frustrating - particularly since I use CTRL-H in VSCode all the time!) I've attached a screenshot to this message showing it in action in a Visual Studio Code terminal window. Everything is available on Github, so anyone who is interested is [welcome to check it out](https://github.com/fasteddy516/SimplySerial). If you find it useful (or not), I'd love to hear from you!*

## Python predicted to overtake C and Java in next 4 years. 

Python's ascent continues among software developers, bolstered by its usability compared with Java and C - [ZDNet](https://www.zdnet.com/article/programming-languages-python-predicted-to-overtake-c-and-java-in-next-4-years/). Here's the [TIOBE Index for June 2019](https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/).

_*This month Python has reached again an all time high in TIOBE index of 8.5%. If Python can keep this pace, it will probably replace C and Java in 3 to 4 years time, thus becoming the most popular programming language of the world. The main reason for this is that software engineering is booming. It attracts lots of newcomers to the field. Java's way of programming is too verbose for beginners. In order to fully understand and run a simple program such as "hello world" in Java you need to have knowledge of classes, static methods and packages. In C this is a bit easier, but then you will be hit in the face with explicit memory management. In Python this is just a one-liner. Enough said."*
