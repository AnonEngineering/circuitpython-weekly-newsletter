## News from around the web!

We now have 1,000 public repos’ on GitHub @ Adafruit Industries. Thank you to the community and our entire team for making open-source, sharing, and working together a core value for what we do! And for our customers, you have a lot of choices where to purchase electronics, thank you for supporting Adafruit because of the repos’, guides, videos, support, fast shipping, service and more! - [GitHub](https://github.com/adafruit?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=&type=public&language=).

Making Robot Friends with the Crickit HAT for Raspberry Pi. Control of the motors, sensors, neopixels, capacitive touch, etc. is all done in Python 3. It’s the easiest and best way to program your Pi, and after a couple pip installs you’ll be ready to go. Each input or output is wrapped into a python object so you can control a motor with simple commands - [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/making-robot-friends-with-the-crickit-hat-for-raspberry-pi/).

## All a board' CircuitPython powered Snowflake

CircuitPython powered Snowflake boards at Stanford's lab64. The event was held to get students excited about electronics regardless of their experience. Students could pick up a snowflake at various “stages,” whether it be presoldered, half-soldered, unprogrammed, etc. lab64 held a snowflake “design contest” that accepted SVG submissions for the board outline, students assembled the board following the [interactive BOM](https://maholli.github.io/snowflake/), [GitHub](https://github.com/maholli/snowflake), [soldering guide](https://github.com/maholli/tutorials/tree/master/soldering%20101), and [gallery](https://sites.google.com/stanford.edu/lab64-makerspace/holliday-party?authuser=0).

## Made with Mu

Why Mu? Mu tries to make it as easy as possible to get started with programming but aims to help you graduate to "real" development tools soon after. Everything in Mu is the "real thing" but presented in as simple and obvious way possible. It's like the toddling stage in learning to walk: you're finding your feet and once you're confident, you should move on and explore! Put simply, Mu aims to foster autonomy. Try out Mu today! - [codewith.mu](https://codewith.mu/)

## Updated Guides - Now With More Python!

**You can use CircuitPython libraries on Raspberry Pi!** We're updating all of our CircuitPython guides to show how to wire up sensors to your Raspberry Pi, and load the necessary CircuitPython libraries to get going using them with Python. We'll be including the updates here so you can easily keep track of which sensors are ready to go. Check it out!

Check back next week for more Learn guides on using CircuitPython libraries with Raspberry Pi!

## CircuitPython Libraries!

[![CircuitPython Libraries]({{ "/assets/22_1023blinka.png" | absolute_url }}){:width="418px"}](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/releases/latest)

CircuitPython support for hardware continues to grow. We are adding support for new sensors and breakouts all the time, as well as improving on the drivers we already have. As we add more libraries and update current ones, you can keep up with all the changes right here!

For the latest drivers, download the [Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/releases/latest).

If you'd like to contribute, CircuitPython libraries are a great place to start. Have an idea for a new driver? File an issue on [CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues)! Interested in helping with current libraries? Check out [this GitHub issue on CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues/1246) for an overview of the State of the CircuitPython Libraries, updated each week. We've included open issues from the library issue lists, and details about repo-level issues that need to be addressed. We have a guide on [contributing to CircuitPython with Git and Github](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github) if you need help getting started. You can also find us in the #circuitpython channel on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord). Feel free to contact Kattni (@kattni) with any questions.

You can check out this [list of all the CircuitPython libraries and drivers available](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/blob/master/circuitpython_library_list.md). 

The current number of CircuitPython libraries is **117**!

**Updated Libraries!**

Here's this week's updated CircuitPython libraries:

* [Adafruit CircuitPython MotorKit](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_MotorKit)

* [Adafruit CircuitPython PN532](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_PN532)

## Call for help – CircuitPython messaging to other languages!

[![Hello world]({{ "/assets/helloworld550.jpg" | absolute_url }}){:width="550px"}](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues/1098)

We [recently posted on the Adafruit blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2018/08/15/help-bring-circuitpython-messaging-to-other-languages-circuitpython/) about bringing CircuitPython messaging to other languages, one of the exciting features of CircuitPython 4.x is translated control and error messages. Native language messages will help non-native English speakers understand what is happening in CircuitPython even though the Python keywords and APIs will still be in English. If you would like to help, [please post](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues/1098) to the main issue on GitHub and join us on [Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

We made this graphic with translated text, we could use your help with that to make sure we got the text right, please check out the text in the image – if there is anything we did not get correct, please let us know. Dan sent me this [handy site too](http://helloworldcollection.de/#Human).
