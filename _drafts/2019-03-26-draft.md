In Make: **Tech Trend #1: The Push for Python**. Make’s overview of Python support for electronics, including Adafruit hardware and more, by Sam Brown.

>_“Were seeing a raft of Python-friendly boards in this year’s round-up of new microcontrollers. Leading the charge is Adafruit. In the last year they’ve launched Python-friendly “Express” versions of their top boards, from the tiny Trinket to the student-friendly Circuit Playground to the Arduino-like Metro and mega-sized Grand Central, and plenty more sizes in between. Whatever your project, Adafruit came out with a Python-capable board to match.”_

## Issue 17 – HackSpace magazine LumiDrive LED Driver … Python control for LEDs, CircuitPython powered

[![HackSpace17]({{ "/assets/32619sfelumidrive.jpg" | absolute_url }}){:width="550px"}](https://hackspace.raspberrypi.org/issues/17)

HackSpace magazine has a review of the SparkFun LumiDrive LED Driver … Python control for LEDs and it gets high marks, 9 out of 10! - [PDF](https://magazines-static.raspberrypi.org/issues/full_pdfs/000/000/037/original/HackSpaceMag17.pdf?1553083666).

>_The LumiDrive is a board for controlling APA102 (aka DotStar) RGB LEDs with CircuitPython. It’s powered by a SAMD21G-AU microcontroller, and has a built-in LiPo battery charger... This board comes set up with CircuitPython, and there’s currently no ability to program it in another language. There’s a guide to getting started with the language on this board at: hsmag.cc/NJcfuF. CircuitPython is a great language for getting started, and it allows you to really quickly add some interactive lights to your build._

## News from around the web!

[![JPEG to BMP]({{ "/assets/32619jpgtobmp.jpg" | absolute_url }}){:width="550px"}](https://danthegeek.com/2019/03/20/display-jpeg-images-from-the-internet-using-the-adafruit-pyportal/)

[Dan made a JPEG to BMP converter for PyPortal in PHP](https://danthegeek.com/2019/03/20/display-jpeg-images-from-the-internet-using-the-adafruit-pyportal/). In less than 10 lines of code, the PHP program reads the URL and desired width of the image, requests the JPEG image from the supplied URL on the PyPortal’s behalf, scales down to fit on the PyPortal display, then converts it to BMP and sends it to the PyPortal. Picture is from an AI generated cat page - [ThisCatDoesNotExist.com](https://thiscatdoesnotexist.com/)

We'll try to verify this for sure, however - according to Ronald at the IndyPyAutomateConf on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/indypy/status/1109170258999472128) - *"MicroPython officially launched April 12th, 2015! It's almost 4 years old now."*

What else is happening? The CircuitPython team will be running several Open Spaces sessions (as they did last year), showing how to use CircuitPython on the Digi-Key / Adafruit PyCon special edition Circuit Playground Express. We’ll have extra addons to play with also: potentiometers, NeoPixel strips, and servos. The team will be running a CircuitPython Sprint for several days to work on CircuitPython libraries and CircuitPython core code. BYOMUSB “Bring your own Micro USB” cables, we’ll have some to borrow during the sprints/sessions, as well as some USB C adapters, good idea to bring one too!

The PyCon 2019 conference, which will take place in Cleveland, is the largest annual gathering for the community using and developing the open-source Python programming language. It is produced and underwritten by the Python Software Foundation, the 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization dedicated to advancing and promoting Python. Through PyCon, the PSF advances its mission of growing the international community of Python programmers.
