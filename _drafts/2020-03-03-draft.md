Hi everyone! It's the latest Python for Microcontrollers newsletter, brought you by the community! We're on [Discord](https://discord.gg/HYqvREz), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/search?q=circuitpython&src=typed_query&f=live), and for past newsletters - [view them all here](https://www.adafruitdaily.com/category/circuitpython/). If you're reading this on the web, [subscribe here](https://www.adafruitdaily.com/). Let's get started!

## CircuitPython 5.0.0 Release Candidate 1!

[![5 OH](../assets/03032020/)](https://circuitpython.org/downloads)

**This is a 5.0.0 Release Candidate — please test!** This is release 5.0.0-rc.1 (Release candidate 1). If this release does not have show-stopper issues, it will be re-released as 5.0.0, the first 5.x.x stable release. Read more on [the blog post](https://blog.adafruit.com/2020/03/01/circuitpython-5-0-0-release-candidate-1-adafruit-circuitpython/) and download at [circuitpython.org/downloads](https://circuitpython.org/downloads).

## Pyloton: Open-source CircuitPython Cycling Computer

[![Pyloton](../assets/03032020/3320pyloton02.jpg)](https://learn.adafruit.com/pyloton?view=all)

Say hello to the open-source cycling computer that displays heart rate, speed, cadence, and song playback info ([video](https://youtu.be/XeAFPAdH4dI))! [Pyloton](https://learn.adafruit.com/pyloton?view=all) is a CircuitPython bike computer made with the CLUE board. Pyloton measures Bluetooth LE heart rate, speed, and cadence. It also provides Apple Music Service song info, combined on one small device with a sharp display and a 3D printed handlebar mount (or optional wrist mount). 

[![Pyloton](../assets/03032020/3320pyloton01.jpg)](https://learn.adafruit.com/pyloton?view=all)

This project is the culmination of three previous Adafruit Learning System projects, plus some new abilities of our Bluefruit code to connect to multiple peripheral devices! Previously, we created these standalone projects:

*   [Now Playing: Bluetooth LE Apple Media Service Display](https://learn.adafruit.com/now-playing-bluetooth-apple-media-service-display/overview)
*   [BLE Heart Rate Zone Trainer Display](https://learn.adafruit.com/circuitpython-ble-heart-rate-monitor-gizmo/overview)
*   [BLE Cycling Speed & Cadence Sensor Display](https://learn.adafruit.com/bluetooth-bicycle-speed-cadence-sensor-display-with-clue/overview)

You may refer to those guides for additional details on the sensors, libraries, and code. Here, we'll show you how they can all be combined into one device. Learn how to make your own open-source bike computer on [learn.adafruit.com](https://learn.adafruit.com/pyloton?view=all)!

[MakeCode Python is here - Makecode.com](https://makecode.com/blog/minecraft/python-release):

>_"Python is a programming language that was created in the early 1990’s which has become popular in data science applications and in education. Microsoft MakeCode already supports Blocks and the JavaScript programming language, and now we’re happy to also announce support for Python! Python is available today in MakeCode for Minecraft, and we will be bringing it to our other code editors later this year. Here are a few of the new features we’ve added to make it easy for students to transition from a visual Block-based language to a text-based language like JavaScript or Python."_

>_"Python hasn’t been singled out in these rankings all that often, in part because its performance has been steady, almost metronomically so. With the exception of one quarter, it spent approximately four years sitting in fourth place, jumping up to third place three years ago and holding – until this month. For the first time in the history of these rankings which began in 2012, we have a non-Java or JavaScript entry in our number two slot."_

[IoT Design Week with Microchip's "Wizard of Make" Bob Martin and Adafruit](https://events.microchip.com/website/7565/home/). We'll be on 3pm to 4pm ET on Tuesday March 10th, 2020 ([video](https://youtu.be/fu37Uf-CXNE)).

## Coming soon

[![Metro M7 RT1011](../assets/03032020/3320metrom701.png)](https://www.adafruit.com/new)

[![Metro M7 RT1011](../assets/03032020/3320metrom702.png)](https://www.adafruit.com/new)

Metro M7 RT1011 w/AirLift WiFi. It's not out yet...so don't ask! It was so cold out, we stayed in and worked on the Metro M7 featuring the iMX RT1011 (the lil sister chip to the RT1062 that stars in the Teensy 4). This chip is really fast, clocking at 500 MHz, and has 128K of RAM. For FLASH, it uses an external QSPI chip which we'll share for filesystem use as well. On the left we put an ESP32 footprint, we use the ESP32 as a WiFi co-processor. You can power it over USB C or a 9V DC power jack, we'll probably change out the 3V LDO regulator for a buck, since the current requirements are going to be high on this board. This is only 2 layers, but we think it might be OK.

[![Stonks](../assets/03032020/3320stonks.jpg)](https://youtu.be/KVpkW4LMaVU)

CircuitSTONKS snakes its way to the NXP iMX RT1011 M7 Feather! Arturo sent us some Feather M7's based on the fancy new RT1011 - this chip runs at 500 MHz but is only a couple $. With plenty of QSPI FLASH on board and RAM, it can make for a nice IoT engine. Here I'm using it with our ESP32 AirLift FeatherWing for WiFi connectivity, and a small color TFT. The code is about 80 lines of CircuitPython - [available here](https://github.com/ladyada/Adafruit_Learning_System_Guides/tree/master/CircuitStonks) and [YouTube](https://youtu.be/KVpkW4LMaVU).

The NAU7802 is once of the few low-cost 24-bit ADCs, designed for bridge/strain-gauge applications. Good for precision sensor applications!

[![Coming soon](../assets/03032020/3320cs_ICM20948.png)](https://blog.adafruit.com/2020/02/28/coming-soon-nau7802-icm20948-and-ds1841-stemmas-stemma-adafruit/)

The ICM20948 is the update to the MPU-9250, we’ve done a few revisions of this tricky chip – it has a 1.8V VDDIO so there’s a lot more level-shifting required to make it 3/5V compatible! But we’re getting close… this chip is interesting in that it has a quaternion-output fusion engine built in! Hopefully this revision will be our last prototype.

[![Coming soon](../assets/03032020/3320cs_DS1841.png)](https://blog.adafruit.com/2020/02/28/coming-soon-nau7802-icm20948-and-ds1841-stemmas-stemma-adafruit/)

Following up on Bryan’s popular DS3502 I2C digital potentiometer breakout, for audio uses we thought we’d follow up with a DS1841 digital log pot! Could be a great add-on for digitally controlled synths!

If you'd like to contribute, CircuitPython libraries are a great place to start. Have an idea for a new driver? File an issue on [CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues)! Interested in helping with current libraries? Check out the [CircuitPython.org Contributing page](https://circuitpython.org/contributing). We've included open pull requests and issues from the libraries, and details about repo-level issues that need to be addressed. We have a guide on [contributing to CircuitPython with Git and Github](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github) if you need help getting started. You can also find us in the #circuitpython channel on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord). Feel free to contact Kattni (@kattni) with any questions.

You can check out this [list of all the CircuitPython libraries and drivers available](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/blob/master/circuitpython_library_list.md).

## What’s the team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Bryan**

[![Bryan](../assets/03032020/3032020bryan.jpg)](https://circuitpython.org/)

Last week I managed to finish both the Arduino and CircuitPython drivers for the HTS221 as well as tester code for it to allow us to verify each and every board as they make their way from the oven to you. I also managed to write guides for both the LPS25 and HTS221. They're both in the cue for manufacturing so keep an eye out for them!

Next up I'm working with the ICM-20948 from invensense. This is a pretty groovy 9-DoF IMU that they [describe](https://www.invensense.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DS-000189-ICM-20948-v1.3.pdf) to be "the World’s Lowest Power 9-Axis MEMS MotionTracking™ Device". It certainly does have lots of neat features that can enable low power operation, so I'm interested to see what it's capable of.

Over the next week I'll be working on libraries, tester code and likely a guide for the ICM-20948.

**Dan**

I finished off the last remaining blocking issues for a CircuitPython 5.0.0 general availability release, and created and released the first (well, zeroth) release candidate. So we hope to have a stable 5.0.0 release soon!

I ended up doing a lot of support over the last week, which brought me back in touch with the kinds of hardware and software issues people are currently encountering. This is helpful in figuring out what to work on next.

**Jeff**

[![Jeff](../assets/03032020/3032020jeff.jpg)](https://circuitpython.org/)

I've continued working on [ulab](https://github.com/v923z/micropython-ulab/) with great ongoing support from its primary author, Zoltán Vörös.  Scott also pitched in by helping us with a problem importing built-in modules whose names contain dots.  There are a number of things to do before it's ready so we anticipate ulab will be in a 5.x.0 release, rather than in 5.0.0.

I also added support for SparkFun's [Thing Plus - SAMD51](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/14713) to CircuitPython.  This board has a similar microcontroller to Adafruit's [Feather M4 Express](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3857), with somewhat less storage for your Python code but a Qwiic connector—compatible with [STEMMA QT](https://learn.adafruit.com/introducing-adafruit-stemma-qt/what-is-stemma) products—built in. This will appear in the next beta or release candidate of CircuitPython.

**Kattni**

This week I continued working with the Adafruit CircuitPython PyBadger library. In preparation for PyCon 2020, I was tasked with creating a simple badge example for CLUE. After deciding I wanted the option to include a preferred pronoun, it became clear what we currently had available wasn't enough. So, I added a custom badge feature to PyBadger. It expands on the Hello-My-Name-Is-style badge to allow you to display multiple lines of text over a color-block or image background. The new feature expands the scope of what PyBadger can do significantly. With only a few lines of code, you can create a custom badge displaying whatever information you're looking to share. The new PyBadger will be available in the [CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries) this week, including examples for PyBadge, Pygamer and CLUE. I'm working on a guide page to go with it that explains how to use all the features to make a custom badge on your Adafruit CLUE. Keep an eye out for that update!

**Lucian**

This past week I worked on the PulseIO implementation outside of PWMOut, which is mostly used for IR sensors. This includes PulseOut, which emulates things like TV remotes by sending a carrier signal in a defined set of pulses, and PulseIn, which interprets this information.

I also wrote a guide for getting started with the [Zephyr RTOS](https://learn.adafruit.com/blinking-led-with-zephyr-rtos) this week. Zephyr is on everyone's radar as an infrastructure layer that's being used in [MicroPython](https://github.com/micropython/micropython/tree/master/ports/zephyr) and may eventually be worked into Circuitpython. It was interesting to get to work with a new RTOS aside from my previous mainstay Mbed-OS, and I'm hoping to move a number of my personal projects to it in the future. 

**Melissa**

This past week I've been focusing on creating a Web Bluetooth dashboard that works with the Bluefruit Playground firmware on CLUE and Circuit Playground Bluefruit boards. I started off with learning Web Bluetooth and after getting the basics down, I started programming a dashboard.

It is a dynamically created dashboard written in pure JavaScript that will query the board for available services and display panels in the dashboard according to how the services are setup. I currently have it reading all of the buttons and sensors that there are currently services for and am now working on code to write to services such as the tone generator or being able to set the neopixels to a specific color. One of my favorite things about this dashboard is that it is so easy to change configuration options and change how you want the data to display.

**Scott**

This week I've been working on wrapping up BroadcastNet. I redid the scanning using `hcitool` and `hcidump` because the bluez interface always deduplicates advertisements from a single device. It's been running reliably here at my house so I've committed and released everything. John Park just got it running so expect to see a guide about it soon!

I also collaborated a bit with Dan on bug squashing for the 5.0.0 release candidate. I squashed the bug where leaving a CircuitPython device with the drive ejected but USB plugged in would crash my Mac. I also fixed a safe mode crash when exiting the REPL with CTRL-D.

I'm vacationing the last half of this week in Colorado. Thursday is a bit of work day because I am visiting SparkFun and meeting up with Great Scott Gadget folks to chat about CircuitPython! The rest of the weekend is vacation.

Next week, after the regular CircuitPython Weekly, I'm going to jump into basic power savings so that `time.sleep` will actually sleep the CPU. Hopefully that basic work will give a big energy savings for all of the BroadcastNet sensors and other CircuitPython boards.
