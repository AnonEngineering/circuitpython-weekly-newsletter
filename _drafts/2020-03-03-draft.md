## Pyloton: Open-source CircuitPython Cycling Computer

[![Pyloton](../assets/03032020/3320pyloton02.jpg)](https://learn.adafruit.com/pyloton?view=all)

Say hello to the open-source cycling computer that displays heart rate, speed, cadence, and song playback info ([video](https://youtu.be/XeAFPAdH4dI))! [Pyloton](https://learn.adafruit.com/pyloton?view=all) is a CircuitPython bike computer made with the CLUE board. Pyloton measures Bluetooth LE heart rate, speed, and cadence. It also provides Apple Music Service song info, combined on one small device with a sharp display and a 3D printed handlebar mount (or optional wrist mount). 

[![Pyloton](../assets/03032020/3320pyloton01.jpg)](https://learn.adafruit.com/pyloton?view=all)

This project is the culmination of three previous Adafruit Learning System projects, plus some new abilities of our Bluefruit code to connect to multiple peripheral devices! Previously, we created these standalone projects:

*   [Now Playing: Bluetooth LE Apple Media Service Display](https://learn.adafruit.com/now-playing-bluetooth-apple-media-service-display/overview)
*   [BLE Heart Rate Zone Trainer Display](https://learn.adafruit.com/circuitpython-ble-heart-rate-monitor-gizmo/overview)
*   [BLE Cycling Speed & Cadence Sensor Display](https://learn.adafruit.com/bluetooth-bicycle-speed-cadence-sensor-display-with-clue/overview)

You may refer to those guides for additional details on the sensors, libraries, and code. Here, we'll show you how they can all be combined into one device. Learn how to make your own open-source bike computer on [learn.adafruit.com](https://learn.adafruit.com/pyloton?view=all) !

## What’s the team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Bryan**

[![Bryan](../assets/03032020/3032020bryan.jpg)](https://circuitpython.org/)

Last week I managed to finish both the Arduino and CircuitPython drivers for the HTS221 as well as tester code for it to allow us to verify each and every board as they make their way from the oven to you. I also managed to write guides for both the LPS25 and HTS221. They're both in the cue for manufacturing so keep an eye out for them!

Next up I'm working with the ICM-20948 from invensense. This is a pretty groovy 9-DoF IMU that they [describe](https://www.invensense.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DS-000189-ICM-20948-v1.3.pdf) to be "the World’s Lowest Power 9-Axis MEMS MotionTracking™ Device". It certainly does have lots of neat features that can enable low power operation, so I'm interested to see what it's capable of.

Over the next week I'll be working on libraries, tester code and likely a guide for the ICM-20948.

**Dan**

I finished off the last remaining blocking issues for a CircuitPython 5.0.0 general availability release, and created and released the first (well, zeroth) release candidate. So we hope to have a stable 5.0.0 release soon!

I ended up doing a lot of support over the last week, which brought me back in touch with the kinds of hardware and software issues people are currently encountering. This is helpful in figuring out what to work on next.

**Jeff**

[![Jeff](../assets/03032020/3032020jeff.jpg)](https://circuitpython.org/)

I've continued working on [ulab](https://github.com/v923z/micropython-ulab/) with great ongoing support from its primary author, Zoltán Vörös.  Scott also pitched in by helping us with a problem importing built-in modules whose names contain dots.  There are a number of things to do before it's ready so we anticipate ulab will be in a 5.x.0 release, rather than in 5.0.0.

I also added support for SparkFun's [Thing Plus - SAMD51](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/14713) to CircuitPython.  This board has a similar microcontroller to Adafruit's [Feather M4 Express](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3857), with somewhat less storage for your Python code but a Qwiic connector—compatible with [STEMMA QT](https://learn.adafruit.com/introducing-adafruit-stemma-qt/what-is-stemma) products—built in. This will appear in the next beta or release candidate of CircuitPython.

**Kattni**

This week I continued working with the Adafruit CircuitPython PyBadger library. In preparation for PyCon 2020, I was tasked with creating a simple badge example for CLUE. After deciding I wanted the option to include a preferred pronoun, it became clear what we currently had available wasn't enough. So, I added a custom badge feature to PyBadger. It expands on the Hello-My-Name-Is-style badge to allow you to display multiple lines of text over a color-block or image background. The new feature expands the scope of what PyBadger can do significantly. With only a few lines of code, you can create a custom badge displaying whatever information you're looking to share. The new PyBadger will be available in the [CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries) this week, including examples for PyBadge, Pygamer and CLUE. I'm working on a guide page to go with it that explains how to use all the features to make a custom badge on your Adafruit CLUE. Keep an eye out for that update!

**Lucian**

This past week I worked on the PulseIO implementation outside of PWMOut, which is mostly used for IR sensors. This includes PulseOut, which emulates things like TV remotes by sending a carrier signal in a defined set of pulses, and PulseIn, which interprets this information.

I also wrote a guide for getting started with the [Zephyr RTOS](https://learn.adafruit.com/blinking-led-with-zephyr-rtos) this week. Zephyr is on everyone's radar as an infrastructure layer that's being used in [MicroPython](https://github.com/micropython/micropython/tree/master/ports/zephyr) and may eventually be worked into Circuitpython. It was interesting to get to work with a new RTOS aside from my previous mainstay Mbed-OS, and I'm hoping to move a number of my personal projects to it in the future. 

**Melissa**

This past week I've been focusing on creating a Web Bluetooth dashboard that works with the Bluefruit Playground firmware on CLUE and Circuit Playground Bluefruit boards. I started off with learning Web Bluetooth and after getting the basics down, I started programming a dashboard.

It is a dynamically created dashboard written in pure JavaScript that will query the board for available services and display panels in the dashboard according to how the services are setup. I currently have it reading all of the buttons and sensors that there are currently services for and am now working on code to write to services such as the tone generator or being able to set the neopixels to a specific color. One of my favorite things about this dashboard is that it is so easy to change configuration options and change how you want the data to display.

**Scott**

This week I've been working on wrapping up BroadcastNet. I redid the scanning using `hcitool` and `hcidump` because the bluez interface always deduplicates advertisements from a single device. It's been running reliably here at my house so I've committed and released everything. John Park just got it running so expect to see a guide about it soon!

I also collaborated a bit with Dan on bug squashing for the 5.0.0 release candidate. I squashed the bug where leaving a CircuitPython device with the drive ejected but USB plugged in would crash my Mac. I also fixed a safe mode crash when exiting the REPL with CTRL-D.

I'm vacationing the last half of this week in Colorado. Thursday is a bit of work day because I am visiting SparkFun and meeting up with Great Scott Gadget folks to chat about CircuitPython! The rest of the weekend is vacation.

Next week, after the regular CircuitPython Weekly, I'm going to jump into basic power savings so that `time.sleep` will actually sleep the CPU. Hopefully that basic work will give a big energy savings for all of the BroadcastNet sensors and other CircuitPython boards.
