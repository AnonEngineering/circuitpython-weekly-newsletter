## Coming soon - Wing it' & use the force

Inspired by our latest Hallowing Lightsaber project, we thought it would be neat to have a 'Saber 'Wing for general purpose props and sabers. This is our first attempt at a layout - it has an audio amplifier, 3 axis accelerometer to detect swings/hits, NeoPixel port with level shifting, switch pins for mode selection, and an RGB driver circuit that can power a 1 Watt LED or an RGB mode indicator!

[@geekgirlbeta's](https://twitter.com/geekgirlbeta) PyCon Australia [talk](https://2018.pycon-au.org/talks/45177-lighting-macro-photographs-with-circuitpython/), "Lighting Macro Photographs with CircuitPython. LED lighting rigs are expensive. Worse, they have little to no controls aside from on/off. Most are not dimmable and changing colors requires the use of gels. In this talk I will discuss how CircuitPython was used in conjunction with LEDs and microcontrollers to make a custom LED photo lighting rig." - [YouTube.](https://youtu.be/JAgCZ70Q3sg). Pictured above, a great slide from the talk!
