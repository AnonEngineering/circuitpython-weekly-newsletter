## Feather format takes flight with the SparkFun Thing Plus

[![FeatherThing](../assets/05282019/52819sfe.jpg)](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/14713)

Adafruit Feather format takes flight with the [SparkFun Thing Plus – SAMD51 – DEV-14713](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/14713) -

"_Is it power you seek? With a 32-bit ARM Cortex-M4F MCU, the SparkFun SAMD51 Thing Plus is one of our most powerful microcontroller boards yet! The SAMD51 Thing Plus provides you with an economical and easy to use development platform if you’re needing more power with minimal working space. This Thing even comes flashed with the same convenient UF2 bootloader as the RedBoard Turbo. To make the Thing Plus even easier to use, we’ve moved a few pins around to make the board Feather compatible…"_

UF2 bootloader, Feather pin layout, should also be easy to get CircuitPython runnin’ on it too. According to [one of the developers](https://www.sparkfun.com/news/2930#comment-5ce8150487756d6dfa678ce3), expect it soon *"The CircuitPython firmware for the board should be built up next week."*

## Call for help – CircuitPython messaging to other languages!

[![Hello world](../assets/05282019/52819hello.jpg)](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues/1098)

We [posted on the Adafruit blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2018/08/15/help-bring-circuitpython-messaging-to-other-languages-circuitpython/) about bringing CircuitPython messaging to other languages, one of the exciting features of CircuitPython 4.x is translated control and error messages. Native language messages will help non-native English speakers understand what is happening in CircuitPython even though the Python keywords and APIs will still be in English. If you would like to help, [please post](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues/1098) to the main issue on GitHub and join us on [Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

We made this graphic with translated text, we could use your help with that to make sure we got the text right, please check out the text in the image – if there is anything we did not get correct, please let us know. Dan sent me this [handy site too](http://helloworldcollection.de/#Human).
