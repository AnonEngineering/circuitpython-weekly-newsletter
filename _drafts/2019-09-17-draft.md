## Hanselminutes Technology Podcast – Learning CircuitPython with Scott Shawcroft

[![Hanselminutes Technology Podcast](../assets/09172019/91719scottcast.jpg)](https://www.hanselminutes.com/701/learning-circuitpython-with-scott-shawcroft)

Hanselminutes Technology Podcast – Fresh Air and Fresh Perspectives for Developers – [Learning CircuitPython with Scott Shawcroft](https://www.hanselminutes.com/701/learning-circuitpython-with-scott-shawcroft):

>_"CircuitPython is a programming language designed to simplify experimenting and learning to code on low-cost microcontroller boards. The history of CircuitPython begins with MicroPython, a Python interpreter written from scratch for embedded systems by Damien George starting in 2013. Three years later, Adafruit hired Shawcroft to port MicroPython to the SAMD21 chip they use on many of their boards. The Scott talks about how to lower the barrier to entry and how to enable beginners to be productive with CircuitPython."_

## Call for Proposals for PyCon 2020 is open!

[![Call for Proposals for PyCon 2020 is open](../assets/09172019/91719Pycon_2020_header-01-2.png)](https://pycon.blogspot.com/2019/09/call-for-proposals-for-pycon-2020-is.html)

[Call for Proposals for PyCon 2020 is open](https://pycon.blogspot.com/2019/09/call-for-proposals-for-pycon-2020-is.html) -

>_"We need beginner, intermediate, and advanced proposals on all sorts of topics as well as beginner, intermediate, and advanced speakers to present talks. You don’t need to be a 20-year veteran who has spoken at dozens of conferences. On all fronts, we need all types of people. That’s what this community is comprised of, so that’s what this conference’s schedule should be made from."_

## The S in IoT stands for security

[![The S in IoT stands for security](../assets/09172019/91719iots.jpg)](https://youtu.be/ISHqKL1okno)

The running joke is that the ‘S’ in IoT stands for security…cause its never there. But safety and security is something you will need to think about at all steps of your design process. There’s going to be billions of IoT devices on-line around the world, many of which will be connected to the Internet, and almost all of them will be unmonitored. A 2015 survey by authentication service provider Auth0 found that 85% of IoT developers admitted to being pressured to get a product to market before adequate security could be implemented. And as an engineer, you’re probably used to that pressure to get a product to market, in which case, selling features often get more attention than security.

With more and more of these connected devices being rushed to market, they’ve become a lucrative target. The 2016 Mirai botnet attack used unsecured CCTV cameras that were connected to the Internet to launch a crippling denial of service attack. That one wasn’t even using the cameras to spy on people, it was just using the TCP/IP stack of the embedded linux device to send lots of junk traffic.

Having security as a priority for your engineering and marketing team will not just help you sleep well at night. As we’ve seen with the European GDPR regulations, privacy and security are being legislated. Having poor security will now get you fined and banned in the marketplace. It’s nearly impossible to add security after the fact, so if you want to avoid a devastating recall – listen up and take security seriously.

## A mini PiTFT display with STEMMA QT connector

[![A mini PiTFT display with STEMMA QT connector](../assets/09172019/91719stemmasun.jpg)](https://youtu.be/DR8Q3fwvGZY)

As displays have gotten smaller and higher res, we've seen some really cute mini TFTs. this one is only 1.1" but has 240x135 pixels, great for a little display. we wrote a kernel driver for it, and with the STEMMA QT connector on the bottom, its ez to connect sensors like this MSA301. Then run python scripts to print out the motion output. Fun! - [YouTube](https://youtu.be/DR8Q3fwvGZY).
