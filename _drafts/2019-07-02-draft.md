## 6,000 Thanks!

[![6000 Thanks](../assets/07022019/72196kthanks.jpg)](https://www.adafruitdaily.com/category/circuitpython/)

We started the Python on microcontrollers newsletter in November of 2016, since then we've published 129 newsletters (including this one!). We're so thankful for all the readers and contributors. We are celebrating over 6,000 subscribers as of last week, thank you! Check out all the archives here - [adafruitdaily.com](https://www.adafruitdaily.com/category/circuitpython/).

## CircuitPython 4.1.0 Beta 1 Released!

[![CircuitPython 4.1.0 Beta 1 Released](../assets/07022019/)](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/releases/tag/4.1.0-beta.1)

4.1.0's biggest feature is speed! General execution of Python should be 2-5x faster and display refreshing will be faster as well.

This is the second beta version for testing. It shouldn't break any code compatible with previous 4.x releases. Please use the latest 4.x stable release [(available from the new website!)](https://circuitpython.org/downloads) when first starting with CircuitPython. It is stable.

## CircuitPython Powered AT Hand-Raiser

[![CircuitPython Powered AT Hand-Raiser](../assets/07022019/)](https://learn.adafruit.com/AT-Hand-Raiser?view=all)

Bill has a great guide on [learn.adafruit.com](https://learn.adafruit.com/AT-Hand-Raiser?view=all) showing how to use CircuitPython to make an assistive hand-raiser - 

>_"Sometimes folks need help doing the simple things that most of us take for granted - that's where Assistive Technology comes into play.  For example, ATMakers recently had a college student reach out and ask for help getting her professor's attention in class. The problem was she has Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) and couldn't raise her hand.  So, we created this small Trinket-powered device that attaches to her laptop or tablet and lights up when she wants to participate! Along the way, we found a fantastic way to control CircuitPython code using nothing more than the USB cord and Windows, Mac or Linux scripts loaded on the Trinket itself."_

## iOS 13 beta erases files off drive, resets iPad: FAT12 issue it seems…

[![iOS 13](../assets/07022019/7219ios13future.jpg)](https://blog.adafruit.com/2019/06/25/ios-13-beta-1-erases-files-off-drive-resets-ipad-fat12-issue-it-seems-apple/)

The upcoming iOS 13 allows iPads to be more like computers, which means being able to do computer-like things such as plugging in a USB drive, opening up the Files app in iOS 13 and browsing the files. This is going to be fantastic for folks who want to use an iPad as their full-time desktop replacement, and if you’re a coder it looks like you’ll be able to do things like opening up Python .py files, use IDEs for coding, etc.

However! iOS beta 1 deletes files off some devices that are USB-Drive-like, for example, all the CircuitPython boards. The iPad also resets itself, so that’s not super-great either.

We documented it [(video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ddhFHehK-4) the best we could to make sure it's fixed before the iOS 13 release - [Adafruit](https://blog.adafruit.com/2019/06/25/ios-13-beta-1-erases-files-off-drive-resets-ipad-fat12-issue-it-seems-apple/).

Want to write a message to your PyPortal’s display? Perhaps you’d like to easily add and change text on your PyPortal’s display to use it as a smart sticky-note, or have people email it directly!
U
sing Zapier, you will set up a Zap to receive email via a custom Zapier email address at zapiermail.com and forward it to an Adafruit IO Feed.

With some CircuitPython Code, your PyPortal will be obtaining the current value of an Adafruit IO Feed and updating the display with the email sender address and the subject line.

>_"We’ve been including the excellent Thonny Python development environment in Raspbian for some time now. In this release, it’s now our default Python editor, and to that end, we are no longer including IDLE by default. IDLE has always felt dated and not very pleasant to use, and Thonny is so much nicer that we’d strongly recommend moving to it, if you haven’t already! (If you’d like an alternative to Thonny, the Mu Python IDE is also still available in Recommended Software.)"_

## CircuitPython Libraries!

[![CircuitPython Libraries](../assets/07022019/7219blinka.png)](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/releases/latest)

CircuitPython support for hardware continues to grow. We are adding support for new sensors and breakouts all the time, as well as improving on the drivers we already have. As we add more libraries and update current ones, you can keep up with all the changes right here!

For the latest drivers, download the [Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/releases/latest).

If you'd like to contribute, CircuitPython libraries are a great place to start. Have an idea for a new driver? File an issue on [CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues)! Interested in helping with current libraries? Check out [this GitHub issue on CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues/1246) for an overview of the State of the CircuitPython Libraries, updated each week. We've included open issues from the library issue lists, and details about repo-level issues that need to be addressed. We have a guide on [contributing to CircuitPython with Git and Github](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github) if you need help getting started. You can also find us in the #circuitpython channel on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord). Feel free to contact Kattni (@kattni) with any questions.

You can check out this [list of all the CircuitPython libraries and drivers available](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/blob/master/circuitpython_library_list.md).

## Codecademy "Learn Hardware Programming with CircuitPython"

[![Codecademy CircuitPython](../assets/007022019/7219codecademy_python.png)](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-circuitpython?utm_source=adafruit&utm_medium=partners&utm_campaign=circuitplayground&utm_content=pythononhardwarenewsletter)

Codecademy, an online interactive learning platform used by more than 45 million people, has teamed up with the leading manufacturer in STEAM electronics, Adafruit Industries, to create a coding course, "Learn Hardware Programming with CircuitPython". The course is now available in the [Codecademy catalog](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-circuitpython?utm_source=adafruit&utm_medium=partners&utm_campaign=circuitplayground&utm_content=pythononhardwarenewsletter).

Python is a highly versatile, easy to learn programming language that a wide range of people, from visual effects artists in Hollywood to mission control at NASA, use to quickly solve problems. But you don’t need to be a rocket scientist to accomplish amazing things with it. This new course introduces programmers to Python by way of a microcontroller — CircuitPython — which is a Python-based programming language optimized for use on hardware.

CircuitPython’s hardware-ready design makes it easier than ever to program a variety of single-board computers, and this course gets you from no experience to working prototype faster than ever before. Codecademy’s interactive learning environment, combined with Adafruit's highly rated Circuit Playground Express, present aspiring hardware hackers with a never-before-seen opportunity to learn hardware programming seamlessly online.

Whether for those who are new to programming, or for those who want to expand their skill set to include physical computing, this course will have students getting familiar with Python and creating incredible projects along the way. By the end, students will have built their own bike lights, drum machine, and even a moisture detector that can tell when it's time to water a plant.

Visit Codecademy to access the [Learn Hardware Programming with CircuitPython](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-circuitpython?utm_source=adafruit&utm_medium=partners&utm_campaign=circuitplayground&utm_content=pythononhardwarenewsletter) course and Adafruit to purchase a [Circuit Playground Express](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3333).

Codecademy has helped more than 45 million people around the world upgrade their careers with technology skills. The company’s online interactive learning platform is widely recognized for providing an accessible, flexible, and engaging experience for beginners and experienced programmers alike. Codecademy has raised a total of $43 million from investors including Union Square Ventures, Kleiner Perkins, Index Ventures, Thrive Capital, Naspers, Yuri Milner and Richard Branson, most recently raising its $30 million Series C in July 2016.
