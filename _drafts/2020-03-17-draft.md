Hi everyone! It's the latest Python for Microcontrollers newsletter, brought you by the community! We're on [Discord](https://discord.gg/HYqvREz), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/search?q=circuitpython&src=typed_query&f=live), and for past newsletters - [view them all here](https://www.adafruitdaily.com/category/circuitpython/). If you're reading this on the web, [subscribe here](https://www.adafruitdaily.com/). Let's get started!

## News from around the web!

#ICYDNCI What was the most popular, most clicked link, in [last week's newsletter](https://link)? [title](url).

## Made with Mu

Why Mu? Mu tries to make it as easy as possible to get started with programming but aims to help you graduate to "real" development tools soon after. Everything in Mu is the "real thing" but presented in as simple and obvious way possible. It's like the toddling stage in learning to walk: you're finding your feet and once you're confident, you should move on and explore! Put simply, Mu aims to foster autonomy. Try out Mu today! - [codewith.mu](https://codewith.mu/)

## Updated Guides - Now With More Python!

**You can use CircuitPython libraries on Raspberry Pi!** We're updating all of our CircuitPython guides to show how to wire up sensors to your Raspberry Pi, and load the necessary CircuitPython libraries to get going using them with Python. We'll be including the updates here so you can easily keep track of which sensors are ready to go. Check it out!

## CircuitPython Libraries!

[![CircuitPython Libraries](../assets/DIR-LOCATION/DATE-blinka.png)](https://circuitpython.org/libraries)

CircuitPython support for hardware continues to grow. We are adding support for new sensors and breakouts all the time, as well as improving on the drivers we already have. As we add more libraries and update current ones, you can keep up with all the changes right here!

For the latest drivers, download the [Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries).

If you'd like to contribute, CircuitPython libraries are a great place to start. Have an idea for a new driver? File an issue on [CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues)! Interested in helping with current libraries? Check out the [CircuitPython.org Contributing page](https://circuitpython.org/contributing). We've included open pull requests and issues from the libraries, and details about repo-level issues that need to be addressed. We have a guide on [contributing to CircuitPython with Git and Github](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github) if you need help getting started. You can also find us in the #circuitpython channel on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord). Feel free to contact Kattni (@kattni) with any questions.

You can check out this [list of all the CircuitPython libraries and drivers available](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/blob/master/circuitpython_library_list.md). 

The current number of CircuitPython libraries is **###**!

**PyPI Download Stats!**

We've written a special library called Adafruit Blinka that makes it possible to use CircuitPython Libraries on [Raspberry Pi and other compatible single-board computers](https://learn.adafruit.com/circuitpython-on-raspberrypi-linux/). Adafruit Blinka and all the CircuitPython libraries have been deployed to PyPI for super simple installation on Linux! Here are the top 10 CircuitPython libraries downloaded from PyPI in the last week, including the total downloads for those libraries:

## What’s the team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

As expected this past week has seen me working on libraries for the ICM20948 9-DoF IMU from InvenSense. The sensor is close enough to the ICM20649 that I was able to refactor those libraries to add support for the accelerometer and gyro, however the magnetometer is another story.

[![Bryan](../assets/03172020/03172020bryan.jpg)](https://circuitpython.org/)

As mentioned last week, the ICM20948 takes an interesting approach to adding a 3-axis magnetometer to the common pairing of an accelerometer and gyro. Like some other 6-DoF accel+gyro combos it has support for gathering data from other sensors on its own external I2C bus. In the case of the ICM20948 however has its magnetometer in the same package but separate from the accel+gryo sitting on the external I2C bus.

The setup of the magnetometer has been assisted by the aforementioned SparkFun library, however its still fairly complex and has been less than straightforward to finish implementing. I hope to wrap it up today and then move on to more new sensors next week.

**Dan**

Last week's CircuitPython 5.0.0 release went smoothly. I removed old 5.0.0 alpha and beta release artifacts from the GitHub releases since they are available on Amazon S3; this speeds up loading the GitHub release pages substantially.

This week, I've been spending a lot of time trying to debug spurious writes to the SAMD51 internal flash. There isn't an obvious cause. I have a user's program that, when power cycled, causes the issue, and have been trimming it down to find the minimum example. This has been difficult: removing seemingly innocuous things causes the problem to go away.

This week I've been working on the [Adafruit Feather nRF52840 Sense guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-feather-sense/) for the [Feather Sense](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4516). This latest edition to the Feather family is a Feather nRF52840 packed with a bunch of sensors. The guide has everything you need to know about the Feather Sense including an overview, detailed pinouts, and info on using it with both Arduino and CircuitPython, and resources for more details on the board and each of the sensors. I also included a CircuitPython example that prints data from all the sensors to get you started with your CircuitPython Feather Sense project. Check it out!

We've also been working to update [Pylint](https://www.pylint.org/) and implement using [Black](https://github.com/psf/black) on all of our libraries. The updates are moving quickly and smoothly. Thanks to Dylan for all his hard work on this project. We'll be releasing the updates for each library as we go. This will not cause any changes to how you use the code, and it will bring all of the code up to current standards and make it more readable.

This past week, I started working on implementing Web Bluetooth using advertisements, but things didn't go as expected. I wrote a very basic sniffer to see the It seems the implementation for the advertisements portion of Web Bluetooth is not quite as complete as the connection-based portion and it was inconsistent between platforms. We are going to wait for further development to be completed before resuming that.

Since I wasn't able to work on the advertisements, I switched over to working on GitHub issues and Pull Requests. I was able to merge in several PRs that had been waiting on me. I spent a little time focusing on some issues that were still affecting the Raspberry Pi since Buster had been released and busted things that had not been resolved. A user had posted a possible solution to get the TFT rotation on capacitive touch displays working and I was able to take it further and fixed that portion of it at least.

The next project I'll be working on is writing up a guide for adding a Single Board Computer to PlatformDetect so that users can more easily add their favorite boards themselves.

## Call for help – CircuitPython messaging to other languages!

[![Hello world](../assets/DIR-LOCATION/DATE-helloworld.jpg)](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues/1098)

We [recently posted on the Adafruit blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2018/08/15/help-bring-circuitpython-messaging-to-other-languages-circuitpython/) about bringing CircuitPython messaging to other languages, one of the exciting features of CircuitPython 4 and later versions is translated control and error messages. Native language messages will help non-native English speakers understand what is happening in CircuitPython even though the Python keywords and APIs will still be in English. If you would like to help, [please post](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues/1098) to the main issue on GitHub and join us on [Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

We made this graphic with translated text, we could use your help with that to make sure we got the text right, please check out the text in the image – if there is anything we did not get correct, please let us know. Dan sent me this [handy site too](http://helloworldcollection.de/#Human).
