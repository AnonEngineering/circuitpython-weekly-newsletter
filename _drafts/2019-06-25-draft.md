## CircuitPython snakes its way to HackSpace Issue 20!

[![HackSpace Issue 20](../assets/06252019/62519hs20.png)](https://hackspace.raspberrypi.org/issues/20)

Ben Everard in HackSpace Magazine writes about using CircuitPython to easily turn an Adafruit Circuit Playground Express educational/multifunction board  into a USB-connected game controller.

>_"We’re going to look at a really simple game inspired by Moon Buggy – an old terminal-based Unix game where you’re driving a buggy across the moon, and have to jump over boulders that litter your path. In our game, we’ll use the ten pixels on a Circuit Playground Express to represent our moon, with red pixels indicating rocks, and white pixels representing our buggy as it drives around this tiny planet. Touching one of the pins will be the only input to the game – it will make the buggy jump for one step. If you hit this, you can clear a rock and keep going, otherwise, you crash out and have to start again."_

[![HackSpace Issue 20](../assets/06252019/62519hs2002.jpg)](https://hackspace.raspberrypi.org/issues/20)

It takes less than 50 lines of Python to get this game running, here shown in the Mu editor. See the full write-up in Issue 20 of HackSpace Magazine - [PDF pages 86 to 87](https://magazines-static.raspberrypi.org/issues/full_pdfs/000/000/087/original/HackSpacemagazine20.pdf).

## CircuitPython-powered Modular NeoPixel patches

[![HackSpace Issue 20](../assets/06252019/62519swhs.jpg)](https://hackspace.raspberrypi.org/issues/20)

Also from HackSpace, Modular NeoPixel patches by Sophy Wong -

>_"What could possibly be more amazing than hook-and-loop tape? Conductive hook-and loop tape! That’s right, your favourite fastener is available in a silver-coated version that is perfect for making a modular circuit with custom swappable components. In this tutorial, we’ll use it to create modular NeoPixel patches for a jacket. The microcontroller and battery for this circuit will be located in the jacket, and be connected to the loop side of the hook-and-loop tape. NeoPixel LEDs will be sewn into the removable patches. Whichever patch you slap onto your jacket will light up!"_

A Gemma M0 microcontroller from Adafruit will control the NeoPixels, and we’ll program the Gemma with CircuitPython. You can read Sophy’s full tutorial in Issue 20 of HackSpace Magazine - [PDF pages 96 to 97](https://magazines-static.raspberrypi.org/issues/full_pdfs/000/000/087/original/HackSpacemagazine20.pdf).

## REMINDER! Survey - Programming microcontrollers with Python!

If you can spare a few minutes, the interns at Microsoft Garage in Vancouver need your input for a user testing a new PythonHardware Visual Studio Code plugin – [Microsoft Garage Survey](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=v4j5cvGGr0GRqy180BHbRx50AHoXr3BImxtzTGKK4edUMEJNUUFTUUdGRFhOVUg0N0RBN0paOFJBRy4u).

>_"Hello there, we’re a group of interns at Microsoft Vancouver, working in The Garage! We’re looking for insights into your experience around physical computing projects. As well as your interest in trying out a new method of development for your project – say goodbye to waiting for your code to build and compile inside Arduino IDE with C/C++, Python is here to help! This survey will only take 3 – 5 minutes and your insights are very valuable to us!_"

>_"Python: a large and terrifying snake OR the third most popular programming language. This week, Python (the language, not the snake) aficionado Nina Zakharenko joins us for Five Things that you didn’t know that Python can do. And don’t worry, there are plenty of snake references and even a free potato joke. Also, Burke finds snake facts on the internet and Nina tries her first Goo Goo Cluster."_

## Codecademy "Learn Hardware Programming with CircuitPython"

[![Codecademy CircuitPython](../assets/06252019/62519codecademy_python.png)](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-circuitpython?utm_source=adafruit&utm_medium=partners&utm_campaign=circuitplayground&utm_content=pythononhardwarenewsletter)

Codecademy, an online interactive learning platform used by more than 45 million people, has teamed up with the leading manufacturer in STEAM electronics, Adafruit Industries, to create a coding course, "Learn Hardware Programming with CircuitPython". The course is now available in the [Codecademy catalog](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-circuitpython?utm_source=adafruit&utm_medium=partners&utm_campaign=circuitplayground&utm_content=pythononhardwarenewsletter).

Python is a highly versatile, easy to learn programming language that a wide range of people, from visual effects artists in Hollywood to mission control at NASA, use to quickly solve problems. But you don’t need to be a rocket scientist to accomplish amazing things with it. This new course introduces programmers to Python by way of a microcontroller — CircuitPython — which is a Python-based programming language optimized for use on hardware.

CircuitPython’s hardware-ready design makes it easier than ever to program a variety of single-board computers, and this course gets you from no experience to working prototype faster than ever before. Codecademy’s interactive learning environment, combined with Adafruit's highly rated Circuit Playground Express, present aspiring hardware hackers with a never-before-seen opportunity to learn hardware programming seamlessly online.

Whether for those who are new to programming, or for those who want to expand their skill set to include physical computing, this course will have students getting familiar with Python and creating incredible projects along the way. By the end, students will have built their own bike lights, drum machine, and even a moisture detector that can tell when it's time to water a plant.

Visit Codecademy to access the [Learn Hardware Programming with CircuitPython](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-circuitpython?utm_source=adafruit&utm_medium=partners&utm_campaign=circuitplayground&utm_content=pythononhardwarenewsletter) course and Adafruit to purchase a [Circuit Playground Express](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3333).

Codecademy has helped more than 45 million people around the world upgrade their careers with technology skills. The company’s online interactive learning platform is widely recognized for providing an accessible, flexible, and engaging experience for beginners and experienced programmers alike. Codecademy has raised a total of $43 million from investors including Union Square Ventures, Kleiner Perkins, Index Ventures, Thrive Capital, Naspers, Yuri Milner and Richard Branson, most recently raising its $30 million Series C in July 2016.
