## What’s the team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Bryan**

[![Bryan](../assets/02182020/20200218bryan2.jpg)](https://circuitpython.org/)

This past week has been a fun time working on a project and guide to make a Sip and Puff device that requires no soldering and very minimal code! I was able to make use of the [Feather STM32F505](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4382) and its built in STEMMA QT connector to easily plug it into an [ST LPS33HW ported pressure sensor](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4414), as well as a STEMMA QT OLED screen to output status and configuration information.

[![Bryan](../assets/02182020/20200218bryan1.jpg)](https://circuitpython.org/)

Along the way I also learned a lot about Assistive Technology and the plethora of makers helping support it and make it more accessible and even more functional. [ATMakers.org](http://atmakers.org/about-us/) and [Makers Making Change](https://www.makersmakingchange.com/about-us/) are two great organizations that are helping get AT devices based on Open Source Hardware and Software into the hands of folks that need it.

I'm happy to do what I can to contribute and while the sip and puff I was able to put together is one among many, I look forward to contributing wherever I can.

The [Sip and Puff guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/st-lps33-and-circuitpython-sip-and-puff) should be out by now, so head over, take a look, and see how you can use it or one of the many other open source AT projects to make a difference for people that need some assistance in doing things that man of us take for granted.

**Dan**

This week I fixed several of the remaining issues that needed resolution before we release CircuitPython 5.0.0 for general availability. On nRF boards I coded around a hardware bug, so we can now use the fast SPI peripheral. The CLUE board display is now a lot faster. For all builds, I improved the accuracy of the **time** module functions from milliseconds to microseconds.

I helped Dylan and John Park use the BLE bicycle sensor library I wrote last work for a fun project. You'll be seeing the Learn Guide for it soon.

We had a head-scratching bug about why I2C operations were getting slower and slower when used in a loop. I spent a lot of time on this, but it turns out it had nothing to do with I2C *per se*. Instead was due to a particular pattern storage allocations in the **adafruit_bus_device** library. I made the library more efficient, and the issue provoked Scott to make the storage allocator faster

**Jeff**

[![Jeff](../assets/02182020/20200218jeff.jpg)](https://circuitpython.org/)

I'm going on the road for a couple of weeks and packing just the basics to continue on my work with ulab and JEplayer.

When I'm not sightseeing, I'll be busy with improvements to ulab, a numpy-like package for CircuitPython, and porting JEplayer's UI to the PyPortal Pynt's touchscreen.

**Kattni**

This week I published the [Introducing Adafruit CLUE](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-clue) guide. This guide has detailed information about all the features of CLUE with a thorough Pinouts page including images and a fancy edge-connector pinout diagram (courtesy of Andrew Tribble!), as well as setup instructions for both Arduino and CircuitPython.

[![Kattni](../assets/02182020/20200218kattni.gif)](https://circuitpython.org/)

Next, I worked on a series of CLUE demos using the new [CLUE library](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_CLUE): a height calculator, a spirit level, and a temperature and humidity monitor. I put together a quick guide page for each that will be available soon. They can be found under [CLUE CircuitPython Demos](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-clue/clue-circuitpython-demos) in the Introducing Adafruit CLUE guide. The plan is to extend this series of demos. Next up is a compass demo. After that, who knows! There's so many options with the CLUE, the possibilities are endless!

**Melissa**

This past week I continued working on WebSerial and adapting it to work with the new CLUE for calibrating the IMU sensor. Unfortunately, I kept running into an issue where it seemed to get overwhelmed by too much data and would slow way down, so I will probably be taking a different approach.

In order to gather my thoughts a little better, I switched over to working on Github issues for a few days. I've been focusing mostly on fixing some outstanding display issues and added a couple of new shapes to the Adafruit_CircuitPython_Display_Shapes library. Afterwards, I'll be switching back to working on the CLUE board and IMU sensor again.

**Scott**

Last week I continued work on BroadcastNet. I've started getting PRs out, but everything is still pending. This week I'm working on using a Raspberry Pi 3 as a BroadcastNet bridge, with the hope it will be more reliable than an ESP32 wifi link. I'm very excited to use Ethernet for it.

Over the weekend, I attended PyCascades 2020 and it was great to see a bunch of awesome Pythonistas. I was the last talk and the video of it is available here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WdjlznbD0o&t=29274

This week so far, I took a detour into memory allocation performance after Ladyada and Dan found something really weird. It was a really tight loop reading accelerometer data and storing it, where the gaps between reads increased from 1 ms to 10 ms and then reset. Turns out it was an un-optimized allocation case which I've now optimized as well. So, check out the last builds and let us know how it's (hopefully) improved performance for you.
