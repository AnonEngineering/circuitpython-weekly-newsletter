## Python snakes its way to the CASIO Graphing fx-CG50 PRIZM calculator 

[CASIO’s Graphing – fx-CG50 PRIZM calculator](https://blog.adafruit.com/2018/12/06/python-snakes-its-way-to-the-casio-graphing-fx-cg50-prizm-calculator-casioeducate-casiojapan-micropython-micropython/) is the second calculator that we know of that is running a port of MicroPython. The first one we saw was [NumWorks](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3790), it runs MicroPython 1.9.1, the operating system is called epsilon. And now there are two, this may be a trend.

CASIO’s Graphing fx-CG50 PRIZM calculator also runs MicroPython, slightly different version, 1.9.4 . The USA one that is shipping has this pre-installed, at least it was on mine which is running the CASIO version OS 3.20.0202. On [Twitter](https://twitter.com/CASIOJapan/status/1069761266040750080) we saw that CASIO Japan has an update that can be downloaded to add Python support for the Japanese version. On page y-1 of the manual it has the license information for MicroPython (MIT license). On the [MicroPython forums](https://forum.micropython.org/search.php?keywords=casio&terms=all&author=&sc=1&sf=all&sr=posts&sk=t&sd=d&st=0&ch=300&t=0&submit=Search) it looks like there is some discussion about the CASIO MicroPython port, not sure for which calculator though.

We tried to do “import uos” and that module is not supported, looks like just “math” and “random”.

Our favorite feature is going to Connection mode, USB Flash after plugging in the USB cable, and the CASIO storage shows up like a USB drive (like CircuitPython!) from there you can edit/save Python (.py) files for running on the calculator. The VID/PID is – idVendor: 0x07CF / idProduct: 0x6102, 0x0409: “CASIO MassStorage Device”

The chip appears to be a [Renesas CPU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casio_graphic_calculators#fx-CG_Prizm_series). There are some CASIO hackers out there, while it’s unclear what is supported on this newer calc, [these add-on utils](http://gbl08ma.com/casio-prizm-software/) worked.

Python is one of the most popular programming languages, and it's now becoming a standard part of the educational experience, including Python now on at least 2 calculators commonly used for AP, SAT, SAT Subject, PSAT / NMSQT, ACT & IB testing.

## Made with Mu

Why Mu? Mu tries to make it as easy as possible to get started with programming but aims to help you graduate to "real" development tools soon after. Everything in Mu is the "real thing" but presented in as simple and obvious way possible. It's like the toddling stage in learning to walk: you're finding your feet and once you're confident, you should move on and explore! Put simply, Mu aims to foster autonomy. Try out Mu today! - [codewith.mu](https://codewith.mu/)

## Call for help – CircuitPython messaging to other languages!

[![Hello world]({{ "/assets/helloworld550.jpg" | absolute_url }}){:width="550px"}](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues/1098)

We [recently posted on the Adafruit blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2018/08/15/help-bring-circuitpython-messaging-to-other-languages-circuitpython/) about bringing CircuitPython messaging to other languages, one of the exciting features of CircuitPython 4.x is translated control and error messages. Native language messages will help non-native English speakers understand what is happening in CircuitPython even though the Python keywords and APIs will still be in English. If you would like to help, [please post](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues/1098) to the main issue on GitHub and join us on [Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

We made this graphic with translated text, we could use your help with that to make sure we got the text right, please check out the text in the image – if there is anything we did not get correct, please let us know. Dan sent me this [handy site too](http://helloworldcollection.de/#Human).
