## What we're working on ...

There are lots of folks who work on CircuitPython or some of the many open-source boards, and open-source code for the community. Here's what Bryan, Dan, and Melissa are up this week!

**All a board' with Bryan**

Byan is working on the CircuitPython driver for the super-cheap yet capable MS301 accelerometer - [GitHub](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_MSA301/blob/master/MSA301-V1.0-ENG.PDF).

Will also starting on the drivers for the APDS-9500 gesture sensor. This one will be a bit of a doozy, but has a lot of potential in its ability to detect directional gestures on the device itself, once we get them working - [PDF](https://www.mouser.com/datasheet/2/678/V02-4584EN_DS_APDS-9500_2016-10-05-1076498.pdf).

The Large OLED Bonnet is coming along as well. This will be a great display with excellent readability due to the high contrast from being an OLED, combined with the larger pixels making for bigger text or images.

[![BSBOARD](../assets/08202019/82019bsbitsywing.png)](https://www.adafruit.com/new)

Lastly the super cool Airlift "BitsyWing" as we've been calling it should be headed to production soon.

This little helper will help squeeze WiFi and IOT goodness into even smaller places! I'm personally excited to put a bunch of these to use for some home automation tasks.

**CircuitPython Bluetooth Low energy from Dan**

CircuitPython Bluetooth Low energy can:

- be a BLE beacon, including as an iBeacon and an Eddystone beacon.
- be a BLE peripheral, acting both as a server providing services and as a client talking to a server.
- be a BLE central (can scan for peripherals that are advertising and connect to them).
  Currently the Nordic UART Service (NUS) is implemented both for clients and servers.
- pair with a peer device (but not bond, which is remembering pairing).
- connect to a device providing Current Time Service, such as an iPhone, and find out the current date and time.

Support has recently been added for fine-grained control of permissions of Charcteristics and Descriptors.
BLE HID support is current being implemented.

**Maker Melissa makes**

This week Melissa is working on trying to finish up updating the remainder of the display guides with a section on using displayio. Here’s what’s updated so far this week:

* [Adafruit 2.8" and 3.2" Color TFT Touchscreen Breakout v2](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-2-dot-8-color-tft-touchscreen-breakout-v2).
* [2.2" TFT Display](https://learn.adafruit.com/2-2-tft-display).

Why Mu? Mu tries to make it as easy as possible to get started with programming but aims to help you graduate to "real" development tools soon after. Everything in Mu is the "real thing" but presented in as simple and obvious way possible. It's like the toddling stage in learning to walk: you're finding your feet and once you're confident, you should move on and explore! Put simply, Mu aims to foster autonomy.

## CircuitPython Libraries!

[![CircuitPython Libraries](../assets/08202019/82019blinka.png)](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/releases/latest)

CircuitPython support for hardware continues to grow. We are adding support for new sensors and breakouts all the time, as well as improving on the drivers we already have. As we add more libraries and update current ones, you can keep up with all the changes right here!

For the latest drivers, download the [Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/releases/latest).

If you'd like to contribute, CircuitPython libraries are a great place to start. Have an idea for a new driver? File an issue on [CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues)! Interested in helping with current libraries? Check out [this GitHub issue on CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues/1246) for an overview of the State of the CircuitPython Libraries, updated each week. We've included open issues from the library issue lists, and details about repo-level issues that need to be addressed. We have a guide on [contributing to CircuitPython with Git and Github](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github) if you need help getting started. You can also find us in the #circuitpython channel on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord). Feel free to contact Kattni (@kattni) with any questions.

You can check out this [list of all the CircuitPython libraries and drivers available](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/blob/master/circuitpython_library_list.md). 

The current number of CircuitPython libraries is **171**!

## Call for help – CircuitPython messaging to other languages!

[![Hello world](../assets/08202019/82019hello.jpg)](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues/1098)

We [recently posted on the Adafruit blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2018/08/15/help-bring-circuitpython-messaging-to-other-languages-circuitpython/) about bringing CircuitPython messaging to other languages, one of the exciting features of CircuitPython 4.x is translated control and error messages. Native language messages will help non-native English speakers understand what is happening in CircuitPython even though the Python keywords and APIs will still be in English. If you would like to help, [please post](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues/1098) to the main issue on GitHub and join us on [Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

We made this graphic with translated text, we could use your help with that to make sure we got the text right, please check out the text in the image – if there is anything we did not get correct, please let us know. Dan sent me this [handy site too](http://helloworldcollection.de/#Human).

## Codecademy "Learn Hardware Programming with CircuitPython"

[![Codecademy CircuitPython](../assets/08202019/82019codecademy_python.png)](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-circuitpython?utm_source=adafruit&utm_medium=partners&utm_campaign=circuitplayground&utm_content=pythononhardwarenewsletter)

Codecademy, an online interactive learning platform used by more than 45 million people, has teamed up with the leading manufacturer in STEAM electronics, Adafruit Industries, to create a coding course, "Learn Hardware Programming with CircuitPython". The course is now available in the [Codecademy catalog](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-circuitpython?utm_source=adafruit&utm_medium=partners&utm_campaign=circuitplayground&utm_content=pythononhardwarenewsletter).

Python is a highly versatile, easy to learn programming language that a wide range of people, from visual effects artists in Hollywood to mission control at NASA, use to quickly solve problems. But you don’t need to be a rocket scientist to accomplish amazing things with it. This new course introduces programmers to Python by way of a microcontroller — CircuitPython — which is a Python-based programming language optimized for use on hardware.

CircuitPython’s hardware-ready design makes it easier than ever to program a variety of single-board computers, and this course gets you from no experience to working prototype faster than ever before. Codecademy’s interactive learning environment, combined with Adafruit's highly rated Circuit Playground Express, present aspiring hardware hackers with a never-before-seen opportunity to learn hardware programming seamlessly online.

Whether for those who are new to programming, or for those who want to expand their skill set to include physical computing, this course will have students getting familiar with Python and creating incredible projects along the way. By the end, students will have built their own bike lights, drum machine, and even a moisture detector that can tell when it's time to water a plant.

Visit Codecademy to access the [Learn Hardware Programming with CircuitPython](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-circuitpython?utm_source=adafruit&utm_medium=partners&utm_campaign=circuitplayground&utm_content=pythononhardwarenewsletter) course and Adafruit to purchase a [Circuit Playground Express](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3333).

Codecademy has helped more than 45 million people around the world upgrade their careers with technology skills. The company’s online interactive learning platform is widely recognized for providing an accessible, flexible, and engaging experience for beginners and experienced programmers alike. Codecademy has raised a total of $43 million from investors including Union Square Ventures, Kleiner Perkins, Index Ventures, Thrive Capital, Naspers, Yuri Milner and Richard Branson, most recently raising its $30 million Series C in July 2016.
