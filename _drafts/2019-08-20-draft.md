## TBD feature

**DH**

To summarize: To catch, CPy BLE can:

- be a BLE beacon, including as an iBeacon and an Eddystone beacon
- be a BLE peripheral, acting both as a server providing services and as a client talking to a server
- be a BLE central (can scan for peripherals that are advertising and connect to them)
  Currently the Nordic UART Service (NUS) is implemented both for clients and servers.
- pair with a peer device (but not bond, which is remembering pairing)
- connect to a device providing Current Time Service, such as an iPhone, and find out the current date and time

Support has recently been added for fine-grained control of permissions of Charcteristics and Descriptors.
BLE HID support is current being implemented.

This week I’m working on trying to finish up updating the remainder of the display guides with a section on using displayio. Here’s what’s updated so far this week.
https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-2-dot-8-color-tft-touchscreen-breakout-v2
https://learn.adafruit.com/2-2-tft-display
https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-3-5-color-320x480-tft-touchscreen-breakout
https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-1-5-color-oled-breakout-board
https://learn.adafruit.com/096-mini-color-oled
https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-2-4-color-tft-touchscreen-breakout
https://learn.adafruit.com/micropython-hardware-ili9341-tft-and-featherwing

After that, I’ll start on a new guide about a Message Panel that works with preprogrammed messages controlled by a Stream Deck over Adafruit IO.

This week I'm working on the CircuitPython driver for the super-cheap yet capable MS301 accelerometer:
https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_MSA301/blob/master/MSA301-V1.0-ENG.PDF

I'll also be starting on the drivers for the APDS-9500 gesture sensor. This one will be a bit of a doozy, but has a lot of potential in its ability to detect directional gestures on the device itself, once we get them working:

The Large OLED Bonnet is coming along as well. This will be a great display with excellent readability due to the high contrast from being an OLED, combined with the larger pixels making for bigger text or images.

Lastly the super cool Airlift "BitsyWing" as I've been calling it should be headed to production soon:

This little helper will help squeeze WiFi and IOT goodness into even smaller places! I'm personally excited to put a bunch of these to use for some home automation tasks.

## Made with Mu

Why Mu? Mu tries to make it as easy as possible to get started with programming but aims to help you graduate to "real" development tools soon after. Everything in Mu is the "real thing" but presented in as simple and obvious way possible. It's like the toddling stage in learning to walk: you're finding your feet and once you're confident, you should move on and explore! Put simply, Mu aims to foster autonomy. Try out Mu today! - [codewith.mu](https://codewith.mu/)

## Updated Guides - Now With More Python!

**You can use CircuitPython libraries on Raspberry Pi!** We're updating all of our CircuitPython guides to show how to wire up sensors to your Raspberry Pi, and load the necessary CircuitPython libraries to get going using them with Python. We'll be including the updates here so you can easily keep track of which sensors are ready to go. Check it out!

## CircuitPython Libraries!

[![CircuitPython Libraries]({{ "/assets/22_1023blinka.png" | absolute_url }}){:width="418px"}](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/releases/latest)

CircuitPython support for hardware continues to grow. We are adding support for new sensors and breakouts all the time, as well as improving on the drivers we already have. As we add more libraries and update current ones, you can keep up with all the changes right here!

For the latest drivers, download the [Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/releases/latest).

If you'd like to contribute, CircuitPython libraries are a great place to start. Have an idea for a new driver? File an issue on [CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues)! Interested in helping with current libraries? Check out [this GitHub issue on CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues/1246) for an overview of the State of the CircuitPython Libraries, updated each week. We've included open issues from the library issue lists, and details about repo-level issues that need to be addressed. We have a guide on [contributing to CircuitPython with Git and Github](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github) if you need help getting started. You can also find us in the #circuitpython channel on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord). Feel free to contact Kattni (@kattni) with any questions.

You can check out this [list of all the CircuitPython libraries and drivers available](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/blob/master/circuitpython_library_list.md).

**PyPI Download Stats!**

We've written a special library called Adafruit Blinka that makes it possible to use CircuitPython Libraries on [Raspberry Pi and other compatible single-board computers](https://learn.adafruit.com/circuitpython-on-raspberrypi-linux/). Adafruit Blinka and all the CircuitPython libraries have been deployed to PyPI for super simple installation on Linux! Here are the top 10 CircuitPython libraries downloaded from PyPI in the last week, including the total downloads for those libraries:

## Call for help – CircuitPython messaging to other languages!

[![Hello world]({{ "/assets/helloworld550.jpg" | absolute_url }}){:width="550px"}](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues/1098)

We [recently posted on the Adafruit blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2018/08/15/help-bring-circuitpython-messaging-to-other-languages-circuitpython/) about bringing CircuitPython messaging to other languages, one of the exciting features of CircuitPython 4.x is translated control and error messages. Native language messages will help non-native English speakers understand what is happening in CircuitPython even though the Python keywords and APIs will still be in English. If you would like to help, [please post](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues/1098) to the main issue on GitHub and join us on [Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

We made this graphic with translated text, we could use your help with that to make sure we got the text right, please check out the text in the image – if there is anything we did not get correct, please let us know. Dan sent me this [handy site too](http://helloworldcollection.de/#Human).
